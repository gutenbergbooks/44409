<h2><span class="smcap">Introduction</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wenn es eine Stufenleiter von Leiden giebt, so hat Israel
die höchste Staffel erstiegen; wenn die Dauer der Schmerzen
und die Geduld, mit welcher sie ertragen werden, adeln, so nehmen
es die Juden mit den Hochgeborenen aller Länder auf;
wenn eine Literatur reich genannt wird, die wenige klassische
Trauerspiele besitzt, welcher Platz gebührt dann einer Tragödie,
die anderthalb Jahrtausende währt gedichtet und dargestellt von
den Helden selber?"</p>

<p class="sig">
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Zunz</span>: <cite>Die Synagogale Poesie des Mittelalters</cite>.
</p></blockquote>


<p>When the impatient youth demands, like the heathen
from Hillel, a definition of Judaism, bid him "go and
learn" the history of the Jew. Let him follow the fascinating
story from hoar antiquity, when the obscure Hebrews,
"leaving kindred and father's house," took a bold
and new departure for the land that God would show&mdash;the
land that would show God.</p>

<p>Point to the colossal figure of Moses on Sinai, "greatest
of the prophets," who gave the first uplifting impulse
with his Ten Words of Faith and Duty. Trace with him
the soul struggle of this "fewest of all peoples" to reach
the truth of divinity&mdash;beginning with a crude conception
that became steadily more exalted and more clarified with
each successive age, until, at last, the idea is realized of an
all-pervading Spirit, with "righteousness and justice as
the pillars of His throne," the "refuge of all generations."</p>

<p>Make clear to him how the revelation of the divine will
came to be expressed in Law. And, how the preservation
and development of this Law, in the interpreting
hands of prophets, scribes, rabbis, poets and philosophers,
became henceforth the controlling motif of the history
of the Jew, his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</i>, whether under Babylonians,
Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabians or Franks.
Help him to see that through it the Jew held in his keeping
the religious fate of Orient and Occident, that took
from him their respective impressions of Islamism and
Christianity.</p>

<p>Let him see the "God-intoxicated" teaching his message
by living it; the Suffering Servant whose martyrdom
brought healing to his smiters.</p>

<p>Then, perhaps, he may understand that no one definition
can completely express the Faith of the Jew and his
place in the divine economy. But with this glimpse of
his history the grandeur of his inheritance will sink into
his consciousness, becoming part of himself, and he will
be thrilled with the tremendous responsibility devolving
upon him as a member of the priest-people, the witnesses
of God, whose mission was and is to "bring light to the
Gentiles&mdash;that salvation may reach to the ends of the
earth."</p>

<h2>Preface to the Revised Edition<a name="preface" id="preface"></a></h2>


<p>The dual purpose of the revision of this work has been
simplification and amplification.</p>

<p>The language has been recast in parts and there have
been added sub-titles within each chapter, cross-references
and an index. Ideas such as "Religion as law,"
the Logos of Philo and the development of Messianism
have been made as simple as these subjects admit of.</p>

<p>In seeking illustrations to vivify the narrative it is
unfortunate that so little is available. Ah! if we had pictures
of Hillel, of Akiba the Martyr, of Judah the Saint,
of the Jamnia Academy, of the splendor of the Babylonian
Exilarch. But this very absence of pictures is in itself
a bit of Jewish history.</p>

<p>This new edition contains quotations from the literature
of the periods covered, from the Apocrypha, Philo,
Josephus and the Mishna. Three chapters have been added,
two on "Stories and Sayings of the Sages of the Talmud"
and one on "Rabbi Judah and his times." Other
chapters have been placed in more logical sequence. Both
the Chronological Tables and the Notes are fuller. A new
feature has been introduced in a "theme for discussion"
at the close of each chapter that may be found helpful to
study circles and Chautauqua societies. This has also been
introduced in the recently issued "Modern Jewish History."</p>

<p>The author expresses his grateful indebtedness to Dr.
David de Sola Pool for a most careful reading of the
manuscript and for many corrections and suggestions;
also to Mr. Philip Cowen for the aid rendered in collecting
the illustrations. The author has availed himself
of writings that have appeared on this epoch since the
edition of 1904. He hopes he has succeeded in producing
a more readable book.</p>

<p><br />The story covered by the early dates in this table is
not yet post-Biblical. It is already told in the later Books
of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai and Zechariah i-viii. The
history of this volume begins with the close of the life-work
of these men.</p>

<p>The restoration of the Jews to Judea did not materialize
as gloriously as Isaiah of Babylon had prefigured
in his sublime addresses (Isaiah xl-xlvi.) Life's realizations
very often disappoint their anticipations. Cyrus,
the Persian king, opened the door; but only a poor remnant
returned to a poor land. Even then, enemies made
their appearance, envious of the royal grant, and plotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
against their welfare. So it took many years to rebuild
the Temple and many more to rebuild Jerusalem and to
reorganize a new community. This service we owe to
Nehemiah.</p>


<h4>Political
Silence.</h4>

<p>After the chronicle of Nehemiah's service in placing
the Jewish settlement on a working basis, we are told
hardly anything more of the doings of Israel in this
epoch. Either there was no further historic incident of
the Jews under Persian sway, or it has never been told.
There is a silence of about a hundred years after the
last chapter of Nehemiah, which is, roughly speaking,
the last chapter of Jewish history in the Bible. One reason
for this silence of course, is that the Jews had no
separate political life. They were a subject people; their
State was gone. What there is to tell can be disposed of
in a few sentences.</p>

<p>We perhaps infer from the sixty-third chapter of Isaiah
that they suffered during the campaigns of the two
Artaxerxes against Egypt. We know that some were
banished to the Caspian Sea because they were implicated
in a wide-spread insurrection against the fast declining
Persia, instigated by the different peoples settled around
the Mediterranean shore. We are told further that an
upstart named Bagoas heavily taxed the Jews and made
a quarrel over the priesthood an excuse to desecrate their
Temple.</p>

<p>That is really all. When this intriguer attempted to
place his own candidate on the Persian throne the knell
had been rung. Persia's days were numbered. Like its
Babylonian predecessor, it had been "weighed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
balance and found wanting." The Greek forces of Alexander
were advancing and about the year 332 the Persian
dynasty, founded by Cyrus&mdash;let us say "The Great"&mdash;passed
away.</p>


<h4>Religious
Activity.</h4>

<p>But silent though the period was in external doings, it
was a stirring time in Israel for what we might call the
experience of the soul. When we turn to the religious
life of the Jews, the epoch, apparently so barren, is full
of significance. Great achievements are here disclosed
behind the historian's silence.</p>

<p>To tell the religious story, we must go back to Ezra
again&mdash;the Ezra who came to Judea with the second
group of Babylonian exiles and who revived the religious
life of the community (<cite>People of the Book</cite>, vol. iii, ch.
xxxiv), was the father of the <em>Scribes</em>. A scribe was
not merely, as the name might imply, one who copied the
writings of others, but one who expounded them. The
Pentateuch, which contains many codes of law in Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, came to be
called "the Law" as a whole. (Torah.) We shall learn
how this term later came to include the vaster code that
was gradually deduced from these Biblical books. In
fact, from now on, <em>Judaism is interpreted as law</em>.</p>

<p>How did it happen that the Jewish religion was accepted
by its observers as a Law? In ancient times Religion
and State were one. There was not that division
between sacred affairs and secular that we are familiar
with to-day. Duty to God and the King were allied;
patriotism merged into piety. Hence the Pentateuch contains
laws touching civil as well as spiritual relations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and regulates affairs both secular and sacred. For example,
it contains laws about kings, servants, agriculture,
war, food, dress, courts of justice, loans, inheritance,
in fact every need that arose in the civilization of the
time. It contains the Decalogue, regulations for festivals
and sacrificial worship, duties to the poor, the
stranger, the dumb animal, the code of Holiness
(Levit. xvii-xxvii), and exhortations to noble living. It
is beautiful to notice how the moral pervades the secular
and gives to all a sanctifying touch.</p>

<p>Thus the scribes of this latter day had to interpret
Scripture for the daily affairs of public life as well as
for the regulation of the holy seasons and the religious
ceremonial in Israel's semi-independent state. So the
Sanhedrin (a Greek word), a body of seventy members,
was both a House of Legislature and an ecclesiastical
council. It numbered 70 like the Council of Elders appointed
by Moses (Exodus xxiv, 1).</p>

<p>Thus it happened when all political power was taken,
from the Jews, the presentation of religion through the
forms of law very naturally survived.</p>

<p>There is yet another reason for Judaism being interpreted
as Law, which touches the genius of Judaism.
Judaism has always been less a faith to be confessed
than a life to be lived. The emphasis was laid on deed
rather than on dogma, on law rather than creed. We
shall later see (p. 133) that it was on this very distinction
that Christianity broke away from the parent religion
to become a separate Faith.</p>

<p>The reduction of religion to law had its abuses as well
as its excellences. It led to the multiplication of ceremonials.
The laws of ritual cleanliness, especially for
the priests and of Sabbath observance, were very voluminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and very minute. Perhaps too much importance
was laid on minor detail; there was little room for voluntary
and spontaneous action. On the other hand, too
much freedom in religious observance has its dangers and
pitfalls too. At its best the Jewish Law tended to sanctify
every act of life and to bring the humblest obligation
into relationship with God. But whenever a religion
crystallizes into an institution, as it inevitably must, the
spirit occasionally gets lost in the form. Then it becomes
the function of the prophet to bring back the emphasis
to religion's vital issues.</p>


<h4>Priest and
Synagogue.</h4>

<p>A further word on the religious life of post-exilic Israel.
We must remember at the start that Judea was a
colony subject to Persia, but enjoyed complete autonomy
in the management of its internal affairs. The head of
the community was the High Priest. He not only regulated
all functions in the Temple (the religious centre),
but because religion and government could not be entirely
separated, as explained above, he exercised secular
power too. As the high-priesthood became a hereditary
office it acquired quite a royal distinction. This regal
splendor and "temporal" power in the High Priest's
hands were to cause Israel much woe later and became
one of the causes of its downfall.</p>

<p>Distinct from the Temple, Houses of Prayer were
springing up, called Synagogues. The Synagogue gradually
developed a distinct ritual, and Sabbath readings
from the Pentateuch and the Prophets became a permanent
institution. This is treated in fuller detail in chapter
xxv.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The religious activities and conditions here described
were not limited to the Persian era, but continued in
the Greek period that immediately followed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A word about the literature of this Second-Temple or
post-exilic epoch. The most important of the later Biblical
books are ascribed to it, notably the Holy Writings,
specified below.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was further the time of literary activity in editing
Bible books already written and deducing new law from
Scripture. But nothing of the Prophetic style of writing
appeared. Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi were the
last, and already we miss in them the earlier Prophetic
grandeur. Ah, the days of prophecy were over! There
were no more great names. But there was a general
body called "Men of the Great Synagogue." "Synagogue"
does not here mean House of Worship, but a
Council of Scholars, consisting of 120 members. Under
this title some noble masters of the Law contributed
splendid literary service, satisfied to sink their identity in
this general term.</p>


<h4>The Bible Canon.</h4>

<p>A sacred collection of writings, accepted as books of
authority on religious life is called a <em>Canon</em>, a Greek
word meaning rule. The task of deciding what was worthy
to be admitted into the Canon of the Hebrew Scripture
was a task of great responsibility. Nor was it completed
at one time. Begun by the Men of the Great
Synagogue, its final completion was postponed until
nearly a century after the Christian era.</p>

<p>The Bible Books were placed in three groups, namely:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<em>Law</em>, <em>Prophets</em>, <em>Holy Writings</em>. This sequence marked
both the order of their importance in rabbinic estimate
and to some extent, the sequence of their production.
1st, The Law consists of the five books of the Pentateuch,
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
2d, The Prophets fall into two groups: (a) the
Former Prophets, comprising the historical books&mdash;Joshua,
Judges, First and Second Samuel, First and Second
Kings, illustrative of the divine guidance of Israel; (b)
the Later Prophets, the Prophetic Books proper:
the three largest, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel; the
twelve smaller Prophets, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah,
Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,
Zechariah and Malachi. 3rd, The Hagiographa (Holy
Writings), was a miscellaneous collections of Scriptures,
some written very late indeed. It included Psalms,
Proverbs, Job; five little books called Megilloth
(Scrolls): Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes
and Esther; Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah and First
and Second Chronicles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These were doubtless selected from the larger library
of Jewish literature only after long discussion. All
were well weighed before being admitted into this sacred
Canon. Some of those not chosen are doubtless lost.
Some found their way into another collection, known as
the Apocrypha, to be considered later.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Enough is assuredly indicated here to show that the
post-exilic epoch was not a time of empty silence, but
one of tremendous activity&mdash;one of the most fruitful
literary periods in our history.</p>

<h5><em>Persian Influence</em>:</h5>

<p>Persian ideas unconsciously exercised their influence
on Jews living under Persian rule. As a result, conceptions
of the future life and retribution beyond the grave
became more definite than in their earlier Biblical presentation;
the belief in angels and evil spirits received
further development.</p>


<h5><em>Judaism as Law</em>:</h5>

<p>That Israel laid small stress on creed is further proved
by the late date of the formulation of any articles of
faith. Even the thirteen creeds of Maimonides (see
<cite>History Medieval Jews</cite>, p. 157), were drawn up rather to
differentiate Judaism from Christianity and Mohammedanism,
than to explain its teachings to Jews.</p>

<p>Israel's detractors say that Judaism interpreted as Law
tended to blur moral distinctions. This is a superficial
and erroneous inference, for it quite as often re-inforced
them and prevented temporizing with duty.</p>

Daniel and Chronicles are taken from the Writings and
placed as follows: Ruth after Judges, Lamentations after
Jeremiah, Daniel after Ezekiel, Chronicles after
Kings. 3d, Job precedes Psalms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>GREEK AND JEW.</h3>


<h4>Alexander the Great.</h4>

<p>The Greeks and the Jews have been the greatest contributors
toward the higher civilization of mankind, the
Greek in the intellectual and artistic realm, the Jew in
the religious and moral. Therefore we discern the hand
of Providence in bringing them together for they influenced
each other. The meeting of Greek and Jew is
one of the great events of history, greater than many of
the battles that have decided the fates of empires.
Greece had already lived her most thrilling epoch when
the meeting began, but Plato, disciple of the moral philosopher,
Socrates, had but recently passed away and
Aristotle, profoundest philosopher of antiquity, still lived.</p>

<p>Macedonia had absorbed other Greek principalities and
Alexander, now sole master, carried his army eastward
in the hope of founding a universal empire. Whenever
he conquered a land, he colonized it with Greeks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
thus spread Greek civilization. Egypt, Asia Minor, Syria,
Phoenicia, and ultimately Ethiopia and India fell
successively before his triumphant approach.</p>

<p>The Persian empire that had been fast decaying, was
included in the great array of conquests. Tired of the
intriguing adventurer placed over them in the last years,
the Jews gladly welcomed the conqueror. Legend weaves
a pretty story of the Jewish High Priest, Onias, going
forth with a company clad in white to meet Alexander,
and that in this picture Alexander saw the fulfilment of
a dream. It is certain that the Jews hailed this change of
masters and many settled in several of the new Greek
colonies he founded. In this rise and fall of empires a
new grouping of the countries took place. The rebellious
Samaritans were quelled and Alexander gave their land
to the Judeans, to whom he further showed his favor by
freeing them from taxation during the Sabbatic year.
(see Lev. xxv.)</p>

<p>Another reason for Alexander's kindness to our ancestors
may be the fact that some Jews already settled
in many places outside Judea became his guides and interpreters
when he entered the unfamiliar realm of Asia.
Indeed, this broad-minded conqueror was a second Cyrus
to the Jews; but there was no Isaiah now to immortalize
his advent in the grandeur of prophetic address, or to interpret
his triumphant advance in terms of divine purpose.</p>


<h4>Judea Part of
Greco-Egypt.</h4>

<p>All too soon, in the midst of his ambitions, Alexander
died. Conflict among his generals followed, and the great
empire was dismembered. In one of the many wars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
which followed, the Jews showed their religious fidelity
by submitting to slaughter rather than defend themselves
on the Sabbath day. Finally, the empire was divided into
the following four kingdoms: The Greco-Syrian, the
Greco-Egyptian, the Thracian and the Macedonian.
Greco-Syria, including the greater part of Western
Asia, with Persia as its centre, was claimed by one of
Alexander's generals named Seleucus. He introduced
the Seleucidan era named after him beginning with the
year 312. This calendar was used by the Jews when
they later came under Seleucidan sway; for this name,
too, came to be applied to the kingdom itself. Many
Jews were invited to settle in the new capital&mdash;Antioch,
on its Mediterranean border. The next kingdom fell to
Ptolemy Lagos and included Egypt and the adjoining
Asiatic lands, one of which was Cælo-Syria, with boundaries
from Lebanon to Egypt, really corresponding to
Palestine. Thus the Jews first came under the Ptolemaic
regime. It will be well to keep these geographical divisions
distinctly in mind. The remaining two divisions of
the empire, Thrace and Macedonia, hardly enter into this
history.</p>

<p>The Jews did not suffer in the change of rule. They
were as free as before to live their own life, and with
even greater political independence than under Persian
rule. The High Priest continued as the head of the Jewish
community, the centre of which was still Jerusalem.
Alexandria, a seaport named after the conqueror, was
made the capital of Greco-Egyptian kingdom. Many
Jews settled there, and it gradually became the most important
Jewish community outside of Palestine, both intellectually
and religiously. If there were Jews in
Greek towns, so also were there Greeks in Jewish towns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
This meant a mingling of the two races and a lessening
of Jewish isolation. Alexander had brought the Greek
tongue to the East; it became the international language;
and even the commercial interchange of commodities
brought necessarily with it an interchange of ideas. The
Orient was becoming Hellenized (p. 31).</p>

<p>The first man of achievement to hear from in this
epoch was the High Priest, Simon the Just. That he
was called "The Just" tells much in a word. Like Aristides
the Good he really earned his title. He rebuilt
the walls of Jerusalem, ravaged by war, and improved
the water supply. Ben Sirach (one of the writers of the
Apocrypha) speaks of Simon in these words of exalted
praise:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How was he honored in the midst of the people<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his coming out of the sanctuary!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was as the morning star in the midst of a cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the moon at the full;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sun shining upon the temple of the Most High<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the rainbow giving light in the bright clouds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the flower of roses in the spring of the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As lilies by the rivers of waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the branches of the frankincense tree in the time of summer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fire and incense in the censer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a vessel of beaten gold set with all manner of precious stones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a fair olive tree budding forth fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a cypress tree which groweth up to the clouds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he put on the robe of honour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was clothed with the perfection of glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he went up to the holy altar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made glorious the precincts of the Sanctuary.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>Here is one of his maxims: "The world rests on
three pillars, on the Law, on worship, and on Charity."
He took a broad and moderate view of life. When over-zealous
souls would wish to impose upon themselves the
abnegations of the Nazarite (see Numbers vi) he discouraged
such extremes. "Why voluntarily renounce
gifts that God in his love has bestowed for our joy?"
That voices the spirit of Judaism. It is said that certain
wondrous manifestations of Divine grace ceased with
his death. These are but legends, but they show how
much he was revered and loved.</p>


<h4>Joseph the Satrap</h4>

<p>Joseph, the nephew of Onias, a man of resources, was
appointed tax-gatherer of the Palestinian lands. A tax-gatherer
was given a military retinue to enforce his
claims. It was a position of great importance, and made
him practically governor of all Palestine with title of Satrap.
He exercised his power with severity. Still he
brought wealth and improvement to Judea and awakened
in the Jews a greater confidence in themselves.</p>

<p>Certainly contact with the Greeks widened the horizon
of the Jews, furthered their culture, and gave them
a taste for the arts of architecture and sculpture. The
Greeks also inculcated love of freedom, the dignity of
man, and intellectual research in the realms of science
and philosophy. But Greek civilization had perils as well
as advantages. Nor was it transplanted to the East in
its noblest form. The best of Greek thought was evolved
in Athens, not in Alexandria. Then too, the Greeks
everywhere were fond of conviviality, so often the stepping-stone
to immorality. That was why the prophets,
from Samuel on so frowned upon Canaanitish revelries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Some Jews quickly imitated this pagan frivolity and dissipation.
Joseph, the satrap, in order to please Ptolemy
Philopater, the Greco-Egyptian monarch, introduced the
festivities of Dionysus (Bacchus) into Jerusalem; these
really meant drunken orgies. Next he imported to the
Jewish capital dissolute dancing-women. These associations
began to loosen the adherence of the people to
Judaism's strictly moral code. Epicureanism, that had
become a sanction for indulgence, was beginning to take
its place.</p>


<h4>Judea Part of
Greco-Syria.</h4>

<p>In the meantime the greed and ambition of kings
changed the map once more. Antiochus the Great, of
Syria, seized Egypt and its Asiatic possessions in 203.
This transferred Judea from the Egyptian to the Seleucidan
rule. Warring nations had played battledore and
shuttlecock with the land of our ancestors since the year
600. Antiochus was checked by the newly rising power
of Rome from retaining all the Greco-Egyptian dominions,
but Celo-Syria including Judea remained under
his sway. In the struggle some Jews sided with the
Egyptian and some with the Seleucidan party.</p>

<p>For Jews were beginning to differentiate; they were
not any more all of one mind either politically or religiously.
Led by the unfortunate example of Joseph and
his successors, some Jews began cultivating Hellenistic
(from Hellas, Greece) habits to win favor with their
surroundings. A Jewish leader of the Greek faction was
one Joshua, who Grecized his name to Jason. This
worldly man encouraged his people to neglect their Jewish
ideals in favor of pagan standards of life. The safeguards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
built around the Jewish Law by the teachers of
old were ruthlessly overthrown. But these traitorous
extremes brought their own reaction. A pious party
sprang up to counteract them and it zealously determined
to fulfil the Jewish Law in its strictest interpretation.
These were the <em>Chassidim</em> (Greek, Assidean), meaning
the pious.</p>

<p>Here then were two extreme parties in Israel&mdash;one,
the Hellenists, whose mania for everything Greek made
them almost traitors to the Jewish cause; and on the
other hand the Chassidim, who observed the law with
a rigidity greater than its own demands; and in the midst
the great bulk of the people, who tried to avoid the extremes
of both.</p>

<h4><br />High Priest's
Office Sold.</h4>

<p>Antiochus was succeeded by his son of the same name,
an eccentric despot who claimed the title of Epiphanes,
the "illustrious," though styled by his enemies Epimanes
"the madman," and in rabbinic literature <em>Harasha</em>, the
"wicked." The rule of this ill-balanced tyrant was to
bring woe to Judea, for which their own internal troubles
were in a measure responsible. Indeed, it was these
discords that drew his attention to this particular province.
The Hellenists, who had grown to quite a party,
sought his interference in their behalf. Jason offered
the king a bribe to make him High Priest and depose
Onias, his own brother. What a blasphemy on the holy
office to fight for its material powers! The pity was that
material power should be vested in a spiritual office, so
the system was wrong as well as the man.</p>

<p>Imitation of Greek life went on apace. Olympic games,
<i>gymnasia</i>, were now introduced into Judea. These
games named from Olympia in Macedonia, Greece, where
they first took place, were also religious festivals and
were accompanied by sacrifices to the Greek god Zeus.
Yet they involved immoralities, so contradictory were
some ancient conceptions of religion.</p>

<p>Menelaus, another unscrupulous character, offered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Antiochus a still higher bribe for the priesthood and
thus obtained it, regardless of the fact that it had already
been sold to Jason. Like master, like man.</p>

<p>Led from crime to crime, Menelaus became a traitor
to his people. He robbed the Temple of some of its
treasures to pay his bribe and then slew the deposed but
worthy Onias because he had denounced the sin. The
outraged people rose against Menelaus, but an armed
guard provided by the king enabled him to hold his office
by force, and saved him for the time being.</p>

<p>At about this time (170) Antiochus IV, like his predecessor,
attempted to seize Egypt. Some patriotic Jews
in Alexandria showed active sympathy for the endangered
nation. Therefore Antiochus on his return from
the expedition seized Jerusalem, aided by the traitor
Menelaus. This attack meant the slaughter of many
souls and the desecration and plunder of the Temple. Not
content with this, Antiochus spread slanders against Judaism
to justify his excesses. The rumor went forth, for
example, that a golden headed ass was found in the Temple.</p>


<h4>Religious Persecution.</h4>

<p>Next year his further attack on Egypt was checked
by Rome, rapidly becoming a great power. Again he
vented his rage on the Jews and determined to exterminate
the Jewish religion by attacking their most revered
institutions, as the most complete means of erasing their
distinct individuality. The predecessors of Antiochus
Epiphanes had encouraged the spread of paganism among
the Jews; but he, less intelligent and more despotic, tried
to force it upon them. He did not realize that where persuasion
may succeed, tyranny often fails. Apollonius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
his general, cowardly attacked Jerusalem on the Sabbath
day, when he knew religious scruples would prevent the
Jews defending themselves. So it proved. Many more
were slain and the women and children sold in slavery.
A general plunder followed. The paganizing of Judea
became now his avowed policy. Therefore a decree went
forth forbidding the recognition of the God of Israel
and His Law and commanding the worship of Greek
divinities&mdash;"gods that were nothings," to quote Psalm
xcvi. The Law was burned and the statue of Jupiter
set up in the Temple. Jewish ceremonial, Sabbath, festivals,
the Abrahamic rite, were replaced by the sacrifice
of unclean animals. At the same time other methods
were employed completely to subdue the people.</p>

<p>The same policy was applied against Jews in Higher
Syria and Phoenicia. But if some were weak enough
to surrender their Faith, many were prepared to remain
staunch to it. Eleazar in Antioch met a martyr's death.
Hannah, a mother in Israel, taught her sons how to die
for conscience's sake. Here are the words with which she
exhorted them: "Doubtless the Creator of the world who
formed the generations of man will also of His own
mercy give you breath and life again as ye now regard
not your own selves for His law's sake." Martyrdom
such as that found its counterpart in many scattered
places. Not succeeding by threats and persecutions Antiochus
once more resorted to arms. Again followed an
unresisted Sabbath slaughter. The walls of Jerusalem
were leveled and Zion made a fortress with a Syrian
garrison. Greek colonists were transplanted to Palestine
for the purpose of Hellenizing Judea. The country
was placed under rigid surveillance. If a copy of the
Law was found on the monthly inspection the punishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
was death. Participation in the festivals of Dionysius
was now a compulsion.</p>

<p>Yet many dared resist. From the worldly point of
view, opposition seemed madness, but religious zeal
counts not the material cost.</p>

<p>In Modin, a town eighteen miles northwest of Palestine,
lived Mattathias, with his five sons, John, Simon,
Judas, Eleazar and Jonathan. Hither in the year 168
came officials of the tyrant with promises of a large
bribe to Mattathias if he would make offering to an idol
and with threats of punishment if he declined. Mattathias
was a leading townsman and his example would
bring many followers. Not only did he scorn the infamous
proposal, but slew a coward who prepared to
obey. That act was casting down the gauntlet to
Antiochus; it was a declaration of war. With his
brave sons around him, the aged hero sent this message
to the people: "Whoever is zealous for the Lord and
whosoever wishes to support the Covenant, follow me."
That became the rallying cry. The little band deposed
the Syrian overseer and the guard. Once more
when attacked on the Sabbath, the Jews submitted to
slaughter. Then they came to the realization that self-defense
was their duty, even on that holy day.
Were they not fighting for a holy cause? They began
at first guerilla warfare on apostates and heathens.
Avoiding regular attacks, they would swoop down with
a bold clash on a town to punish and reform.</p>


<h4>Judas Maccabeus.</h4>

<p>Next year Mattathias died. Simon became the counselor
and Judas was chosen commander of the trusty
band of revolutionists. He was Israel's greatest warrior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
since David. The title given him was transmitted to
his party&mdash;<em>Maccabeus</em>, the Hammer. But a something
more than generalship was to decide this contest&mdash;<em>faith</em>.
Judged by material standards, resistance seemed like a
forlorn hope, but the intrepid bravery of this staunch
band fighting <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro aris et focis</i>, "for their altars and their
hearths," increased the number of their adherents and
even won back the allegiance of some who had almost
drifted from the fold.</p>

<p>The first victory over the Syrians was small, but Appolonius,
the general who had been entrusted with carrying
out the persecuting laws, was slain. In a second engagement
the "rebels" were attacked at Beth Horon,
north of Jerusalem, and Judas won here a still more decided
success over an army much larger than his own.
Antiochus became alarmed. He had not the means to
raise a large army to meet this unexpected opposition,
because all his resources were taxed to meet troubles in
other quarters&mdash;Parthia, Armenia, Phoenicia.</p>

<p>Angered at the rebellion of this petty people, he now
determined on their extermination, Hellenists and all.
He sent Lysias with full power to Jerusalem to raze the
city to the ground. To the Syrians the Jewish defeat
seemed so certain that slave-dealers with money and
chains followed the army, sure of a harvest in their repulsive
trade. A horror like unto that of Shushan in Esther's
days spread through the doomed city. But it
raised champions, even among the Hellenistic Jews, who
were still attached to their Faith when the decisive test
came.</p>

<p>It was in the year 166 that Lysias, the viceroy of Antiochus,
sent an army of four thousand men into Judea
under the generals Ptolemy, Nicanor and Gorgias. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Judas Maccabeus had now a well organized force, although
it consisted of but six thousand men. Before the
struggle began he called a solemn assembly at Mizpah,
where Samuel had gathered Israel nine hundred years
earlier, ordered a fast, conducted a service of prayer and
read the Law. In reading the story of the Puritan war
against Charles I of England and their singing hymns
before the battle, we are reminded of the religious earnestness
of these Maccabees. "When they saw the host
coming to meet them, they said to Judas, how shall we
be able, being so few, to fight against so great a multitude
and so strong.... Judas answered: with the God
of heaven it is all one to deliver with a great multitude
or a small company." The usual proclamation of the
Mosaic Law (Deuteronomy xx), was now read, excusing
certain classes from the ranks; this reduced the
army still more. Then the struggle once more began.
By a clever stratagem Judas Maccabeus met the Syrian
army on a plain near Emmaus, not far from the capital.
With the words of the Law on his lips and with an encouraging
appeal to fight for the holy cause, he gave the
signal to advance. Defeating the first contingent of the
enemy before the main army came up, the next battalion
fled without fighting.</p>

<p>The moral effect of this decisive victory was most
valuable, apart from the fact that the booty obtained supplied
arms to the Maccabees&mdash;the "sinews of war"
both in a literal and metaphoric sense. But Lysias dared
not be beaten. He therefore sent a big army against
Judas, whose force had meanwhile increased to some ten
thousand, proving again that nothing succeeds like success.
The Syrians chose a new route to Beth Horon,
but only to meet the old defeat. This was the turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
point in the war. The struggle was not over, but confidence
was restored and a respite gained.</p>


<h4>Feast of Hanukkah.</h4>

<p>Judas Maccabeus marched to the capital and a sorry
picture of desolation met his gaze. His first work was
to remove all signs of idolatry and desecration. A new
altar was built, the Temple was repaired and cleaned and
on Kislev the 25th in the year 165, it was reconsecrated.
The ceremony recalls Solomon's consecration of the
first Temple; not as splendid a ceremonial perhaps, but it
meant far more. Solomon's Temple had cost treasure,
but this had cost blood. It was more than a civil victory;
it was that least, it was a triumph of the divine cause
expressed in Israel's mission. They fought for Zion as
an idea rather than Zion as a city&mdash;the "Zion from which
goeth forth the law." They proved again that ideals can
conquer battalions. This great lesson is always brought
home to us when we celebrate our festival of Hanukkah
(re-dedication) instituted by the Great Council&mdash;the successor
of the "Great Synagogue"&mdash;to celebrate the victory.
The Syrian had been defeated. He was the enemy
without. But a greater foe had to be conquered, the
enemy within&mdash;religious indifference, that lurked among
the Hellenist worldlings and many faint-hearted souls
throughout the land.</p>

<p>The legend runs that when Judas Maccabeus wished
to consecrate the Temple, but one flask of pure oil bearing
the priestly seal had been left after the enemy's ravage.
It was a measure that would last for a day, but&mdash;marvelous
to tell&mdash;it served for eight, by which time
new oil was prepared. The story is immortalized in the
second name "Feast of Lights," given to the Hanukkah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
festival. The ceremony of kindling lights begins
with one on the first night, continues with two lights on
the second and thus progresses till the eighth and last
night is reached. What is the meaning of the ceremonial
and the story? It is the Maccabean victory told in symbol;
for it was a story of advance from strength to strength.
First, Mattathias stood alone for Judaism's cause, a solitary
light. Next came his sons; then a tiny army growing
instead of lessening with each conflict, from two
thousand to six thousand, from six to ten, then victory
crowned their efforts; and with the conquest on the field
rose the faith in the hearts of the people in the same progressive
way. The tiny embers became a flame, and the
flame burst into a conflagration. This miracle is often
found repeated in Israel's history.</p>

<p>The Feast of Lights is called a Minor Festival in our
calendar, for reasons accidental rather than intrinsic. It
is hard to institute a new observance after a religion is
crystallized. It is still harder to give it the old sanction.
So the rabbis did not venture then to place Hanukkah
or Purim on a par with Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles.
Yet in very truth Hanukkah is a great festival.
None question its authority&mdash;all are thrilled by its stirring
story.</p>


<h4>The Book of Daniel.</h4>

<p>In seeking to realize this critical time of "storm and
stress," we shall be aided somewhat by taking a glimpse
at its literature. For here we see pictured the struggles
and sufferings experienced and the alternate hopes and
fears that swayed the heart of the nation, far better than
in the record of the historian.</p>

<p>A work reflecting these times, the Book of Daniel, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
perhaps the latest of the Bible books. The book throws
light on the epoch and the epoch is the key to the
book. Daniel is written in the form of a revelation
of events that were to happen centuries later, made
known through dream and vision to the God-fearing
Daniel, one of the Babylonian exiles. These visions are
presented as foretelling the main incidents after the exile.
The pictures grow in detail as they reach the Maccabean
uprising (168 <small>B.C.E.</small>), showing that the author probably
belonged to this time.</p>

<p>The first picture is the dream of King Nebuchadrezzar,
which Daniel&mdash;who is as wise as he is good&mdash;is able
to interpret. The dream presented an image with a head
of gold, breast and arms of silver, the lower limbs of
brass and iron mixed with clay. A stone cut without
hands destroyed the image and then grew to a mountain
that filled the earth. In the light of later events, it
is thus explained: The golden head was Babylon, the
silver breast and arms the kingdom of Media, the bronze
trunk Persia, the lower limbs of baser metal and clay
represented the Greek empire, split up into many principalities,
thus bringing the picture down to the rule of
Antiochus Epiphanes. What did the "stone" represent?
It expresses the faith of the writer in Israel's eventual
triumph and the spread of Judaism over the world. But
it was doubtless written when the outcome was still uncertain,
perhaps in the very height and heat of the struggle.</p>

<p>The same march of events is later repeated in visions
to Daniel himself. The four empires are depicted in the
figures of beasts that give the same assurance of Israel's
ultimate victory. "The greatness of the kingdoms under
the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of the Most High; his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom
and all dominions shall serve and obey Him."</p>

<p>In another vision our attention is focused on the events
nearer the Maccabean time. First a ram with two horns
is the Medo-Persian empire. Next a he-goat represents
Greece, its horn Alexander the Great. Four horns that
uprose in its place are the four kingdoms into which his
empire was split&mdash;Macedonia, Thrace, Syria and Egypt,
while a little horn that overthrows Judah's sanctuary is
none other than Antiochus Epiphanes.</p>

<p>A last vision drops metaphor and mentions the kingdoms
by actual name. The persecutions under Antiochus
are vividly depicted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They shall profane the Sanctuary, even the fortress,
and shall take away the continual burnt offering;
and they shall set up the abomination that
maketh desolate. And such as do wickedly against
the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries; but the
people that know their God shall be strong and do
exploits. They that be wise among the people shall
instruct many. Yet they shall fall by the sword and
by flame, by captivity and by spoil many days. Now
when they shall fall they shall be helped with a little
help (the Maccabees).... And some of them
that be wise shall fall, to refine them and to purge
and to make them white."</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 125px;">
<img src="images/illus042.jpg" width="125" height="120" alt="Antiochus" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">ANTIOCHUS<br />
EPIPHANES.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The last reference indicates the ennobling influence
of martyrdom touchingly depicted also in the fifty-third
chapter of Isaiah.</p>

<p>The death of these noble souls deepened the belief
of this writer in the future life, as demanded by divine
justice:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth
shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to
shame and everlasting contempt. They that be wise
shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and
they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars
for ever and ever."</p></blockquote>

<p>The book was certainly written by a patriotic and pious
author to inspire his brethren during that dark struggle,
to urge them to be loyal to God and His Law with the
staunch conviction that all would come right in the end.
It is an appeal to the faith and courage of Israel, with
Daniel held up as a thrilling exemplar. He is portrayed
as unswerving in his determination to be steadfast to
the God of his fathers; on one occasion daring a fiery
furnace and on another a lion's den, and his faith saves
him from both perils.</p>

<p>Who can say how many may have been nerved to be
loyal and to "wait for God's salvation" by these impassioned
pictures? So, next to Judas Maccabeus, the hero
of the Hanukkah story, let us enshrine in our hearts and
memories the unknown author of the Book of Daniel
who fed the faith and the courage of Israel in their
days of sorrow and darkness.</p>

<p><br />This Temple consecration (forever memorable through
the Feast of Hanukkah) was the climax of the Maccabean
story, but it was by no means its close. But this event
was chosen as the occasion for the institution of the Festival
of Hanukkah, not the independence&mdash;that was won
later. Israel took up arms to defend its Faith, not to
win back a separate nation. But its triumph for a spiritual
cause awakened the possibility of wresting Judea
from the Syrian grasp. For a while swords rested in
their scabbards; but it was only an "armed peace." Judas
Maccabeus had to build new fortifications against possible
invasion. The petty nations around all looked on
with ill-concealed jealousy at Judah's victories. Those
who in many instances had become Syrian allies had now
to be met on the field. The alert and energetic Judas
marched out once more and subdued the Idumeans and
Ammonites and won peace and security for his people
dwelling on their borders. Appeals from brethren whose
possessions had been despoiled and their families slain
reached him from many sides. With the aid of his brother
Simon, whom he despatched to Galilee while he marched
to Gilead, these heathen raids were suppressed. Jewish
refugees were brought to Judea. So there were new
rejoicings at these victories on his return next year (164).</p>

<p>The fight for the restoration of the Jewish faith was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
now over, but the fight for the restoration of the Jewish
nation had only just begun.</p>

<p>Not for very long was Judas allowed to rest. It is
far easier to take up the sword than to lay it down. The
never-sleeping Syrians were again in the field, defeating
two of his generals. But once more victory crowned
his arms. In the same year Antiochus, humiliated with
defeats in Parthia and Persia as well as in Judea, came
to a sad end. The powerful monarch had now to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Meet face to face a greater potentate,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">King Death, Epiphanes, the illustrious."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His death left two rival governors for the regency of
the Syrian kingdom.</p>


<h4>Death of Eleazar.</h4>

<p>The obstinate Hellenist party within Israel had not
yet learned their lesson, and appealed to the new monarch,
Antiochus Eupator, to take up their cause. So
war broke out again in 163. It was the Sabbatic year,
when nothing is sown and the land lies fallow. (See
Leviticus xxv.) So these circumstances added further
embarrassment to the usual evils of war. It meant scarcity
of provisions and the terror of long siege. A brave
fight in the open field against large odds brought reverse
to the Maccabees. One of the brothers, Eleazar, died on
the field, a martyr to his bravery. He stabbed an elephant
supposed to bear the king, though like Samson,
he fell in the overthrow he designed. The army retreated
before the second siege was begun. Meanwhile Philip,
the rival regent of Syria, raising an army against Lysias,
compelled this general's withdrawal from Jerusalem. So
Lysias concluded an honorable peace with the Judeans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
allowing them the religious liberty for which they had
at first taken up arms.</p>

<p>The blessings of peace were now theirs for a space.
Judas Maccabeus was made for the time being High
Priest. He was not of the priestly line, but the office
involved the wielding of temporal as well as spiritual
authority. For the former, none more fitted than he.
Yet the more strict were not satisfied that it should pass
from the traditional priestly family! The Hellenist menace
had not yet disappeared, though Jason and Menelaus,
its fathers, were now both dead. This party now supported
a new Syrian claimant for the throne against the
one endorsed by the Maccabees&mdash;Demetrius (162), whose
agent, Bacchides, appointed one of these very Hellenists,
Alcimus, as High Priest. Thus discord was sown anew
in Israel.</p>


<h4>Death of Judas.</h4>

<p>The Syrians with large armies twice repulsed the small
army of Judas, but Nicanor, the cruel general of Demetrius,
was slain in a brilliant victory by the Jews. This
brought such relief to the Jews that "Nicanor Day" was
celebrated in Judæa for some years as a day of rejoicing.
Judas was certainly at the head of the commonwealth
now, even though deprived of the High Priest's office.
Hearing of Rome's great power and recognizing that it
exercised a kind of sovereignty over Syria, Judas entered
into an alliance with it, but too late for its interference
to be of aid. For with a meagre force, discouraged
by persistent war and overwhelming odds, he had
now to meet a large avenging army under Bacchides.
With but a few hundred men he went forth to meet the
picked thousands of his foes, as brave and as determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
as the Greeks of Thermopylæ. When defeat was certain
he yet stood fighting and undaunted till wounded unto
death. So died a great man who had wrought salvation
for Israel. He had made Judah a nation of warrior
heroes exalted by religious zeal. His name, his spirit,
continued to inspire them to determined resistance against
foes without and within. Their religious liberty gained
at such fearful cost, even Demetrius, though now holding
Judea in subjection, no longer dared defy.</p>

<p>"He put on a breast place as a giant and girt his warlike
armor about him. He battled like a lion and the
wicked shrunk for fear of him. He cheered Jacob by
his mighty acts and his memorial is blessed forever."</p>


<h4>Jonathan.</h4>

<p>With Judas the Great and his brother John both dead,
with Alcimus, the Hellenist, High Priest, and with Syrian
garrisons in the capital and all the surrounding places,
there was more or less conflict and demoralization. The
outlook was not promising. But Jonathan, another of
Mattathias' five sons, a worthy brother of Judas, kept
the Hasmonean party together. The obnoxious Alcimus
died, and there was no religious or political head for
seven years. But confidence in Jonathan quietly grew;
until eventually he filled both offices. He strengthened
his forces sufficiently to withstand a new uprising and
even to make it advisable for the Syrians to sue for peace.
So when the Syrian throne was seized by a new claimant,
Alexander Balas, he realized sufficiently the importance
of Jonathan to appoint him High Priest and Tributary
Prince in 152; though the deposed Demetrius,
who still maintained a partial sway, now sought Jonathan's
aid too. The tables were turned and Jonathan held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
something like a balance of power. Jonathan showed his
foresight in remaining loyal also to Alexander Balas,
his son, who became Antiochus VI. The Hellenist party
quietly died out; it never had the people behind it.</p>

<p>Loaded with honors, Jonathan was now given the golden
clasp of independence, and his brother Simon made
a Syrian commander. Enemies had become allies. Loyalty
to the Syrians meant hard fighting again for the Jews,
but the opportunity was given now to strengthen the defences
of Jerusalem and to enable the city and the people
to recover from the ravages consequent on a long series
of wars. Judea had now an army of forty thousand men.
They stood by Alexander Balas when all deserted him.
Even then concessions were obtained from the new king,
Demetrius II., showing that the Syrian power was broken.</p>

<p>The treachery of Tryphon, a general of the new king,
led to Jonathan's death and the massacre of a thousand
of his men. Thus passed another of the patriot brothers.
It is hard to say to whom Israel owed the greater debt,
Judas or Jonathan. Judas saved the nation at a perilous
hour; Jonathan reorganized it and gave it an abiding
strength.</p>


<h4>Independence.</h4>

<p>Simon, the last brother, now stepped forward to rally
and save Judea. This persistence (characteristic of the
resolution of this great family) where only the non-resistance
of despair was looked for, completely upset Tryphon's
scheme and saved Judea from disaster. Like
Jonathan, Simon became at once by popular choice the
religious and civil head of his people with the title High
Priest included. He felt the time had come to throw off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the weak rule of the unreliable, vacillating Syrian power,
though this was far beyond the original expectation when
the revolt began and far beyond its aims. Yet the march
of events made it a logical sequence. He decided to recognize
Demetrius II. against Tryphon on condition that
Jewish independence be recognized in turn. The terms
were accepted&mdash;"We release you from the crown which
you owe us and we remit the taxes that we laid on Jerusalem."
Verily, the yoke of the heathen was taken away
from Israel.</p>

<p>The Seleucidan Era (see page 28) was now given
up with the Seleucidan sway, and the reckoning of years
began anew from 142 with the accession of Simon as
High Priest, Commander of the Army and Prince of the
Nation. This marked again the independence of Judah,
that had been lost since the year 600 <small>B.C.E.</small>, when Nebuchadrezzar
overthrew Jerusalem and its Temple and
took the Jews into Babylonian exile.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE APOCRYPHA.</h3>


<p>In addition to the Book of Daniel there are other
writings that throw light on these times; notably the collection
known as "The Apocrypha." This is a Greek
word meaning hidden or obscure. This title as applied
to their <em>use</em> was to indicate that the books were used for
private circulation, rather than for reading at public worship.
This title as applied to their <em>origin</em> was to indicate
that their authority as sacred scripture was not as certain
as that of the Bible books&mdash;to be included in the Canon
of Scripture. This last application has given a rather
sinister meaning to the word "apocryphal." But the
collection is full of lofty religious sentiment well worthy
to be included in our most sacred treasures.</p>

<p>Like the Bible, this collection was not written all at
one time, nor in one land. It spreads over the period between
200 <small>B.C.E.</small> and 150 <small>A.C.E.</small>, written therefore under
Persian, Greek and Roman rule; some in Judea, others
in the Diaspora, lands of Jewish dispersion. While the
term covers some writings of non-Jewish scribes, the Apocrypha
proper includes the Jewish writings only, and
only such will be considered here.</p>

<p>These consist of fourteen books grouped in the following
order:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="pocrypha">
<tr><td align="left">I Esdras,</td><td align="left">Judith,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">II Esdras,</td><td align="left">Additions to the Book</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Tobit,</td><td align="left">of Esther,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Wisdom of Solomon,</td><td align="left">History of Susanna,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Wisdom of Jesus, son of Sirach or Ecclesiasticus,</td><td align="left">History of Bel and the Dragon,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Baruch (with epistle of Jeremiah),</td><td align="left">Prayer of Manasses, King of Judah,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Song of the Three Holy Children,</td><td align="left">I Maccabees,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">II Maccabees.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p><br />Some are narratives, some books of homilies and maxims,
here and there an apocalypse, i.e., prophetic vision.
While the narratives are not all histories, they are invaluable
as revealing the inner life of the people, their
brave struggles, their deep convictions, and their yearnings
for better things. One idea seems common to all.
Each story is presented as an illustration of the temporal
trials of good men and women, like Tobit and Susanna,
and the ultimate reward of their fidelity; the edifying
purpose throughout tending to foster the faith and courage
of the people in time of tribulation. In this respect
the apocryphal books resemble the book of Daniel, which
might be appropriately included in the collection.</p>

<p>While these books as a whole lack the freshness and
originality and the exquisite simplicity of the best Bible
books, they show in some respects an advance in thought
and survey. There is more mysticism in the apocryphal
writings. Wisdom is personified, almost merging into a
being. Angels and spirits play a larger part. Immortality
is brought to the fore, and Asmodeus, a sort of
devil, appears upon the scene. Some of these ideas,
such as the personification of wisdom and the existence
of a devil, were further fostered in Christianity and developed
into distinct doctrines, while the inherent rationalism
of Judaism gradually threw them off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Now to consider briefly the books in detail:</p>


<h4>I Esdras.</h4>

<p>Esdras is a later version in Greek of the events told
in the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah, but it begins further
back in the reign of Josiah and carries the story through
the exile down to the re-dedication of the Second Temple.
The author breathes into it some later religious
ideas of his own time. The following story quoted from
it is known as the "Dispute of the Courtiers":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now King Darius made a great feast unto all
his subjects and unto all that were born in his house,
and unto all the princes of Medea and of Persia.</p>

<p>"Then the three young men of the body-guard
that kept the King's person, spake one to another:
let every one of us say one thing which shall be
strongest; and he whose sentences shall seem wiser
than the others, unto him shall Darius the King give
great gifts and great honors in token of victory. The
first wrote, Wine is the strongest. The second
wrote, The King is the strongest. The third wrote,
Woman is the strongest: but, above all things,
Truth beareth away the victory.</p>

<p>"Then began the first, who had spoken of the
strength of wine, and said thus: O sirs, how exceeding
strong is wine. It causeth all men to err that
drink it: it maketh the mind of the king and of the
fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and
of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich; it
turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so
that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt:
and it makes every heart rich, so that a man remembereth
neither king nor satrap: and when they are
in their cups, they forget their love both to friends
and brethren, and a little after draw their swords:
but when they awake from their wine they remember
not what they have done. O sirs, is not wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the strongest, seeing that it enforceth to do thus.
And when he had so spoken, he held his peace.</p>

<p>"Then the second, that had spoken of the strength
of the King, began to say: O sirs, do not men excel
in strength, that bear rule over the sea and land and
all things in them? But yet is the King stronger:
and he is their lord and hath dominion over them;
and in whatsoever he commandeth them they obey
him. If he bid them make war one against the
other, they do it: and if he send them out against
the enemies, they go, and overcome mountains, walls
and towers. They slay and are slain, and transgress
not the King's commandment. If they get the victory
they bring all to the King, as well the spoil as
all things else. Likewise for those that are no soldiers
and have not to do with wars, but use husbandry,
when they have reaped again that which
they had sown, they bring it to the King, and compel
one another to pay tribute unto the king. And he is
but one man. If he command to kill, they kill; if
he command to spare they spare; if he command to
smite, they smite; if he command to make desolate,
they make desolate; if he command to build, they
build; if he command to cut down, they cut down;
if he command to plant, they plant. So all his people
and all his armies obey him: furthermore, he
lieth down, he eateth and drinketh, and taketh his
rest; and these keep watch round about him, neither
may any one depart, and do his own business, neither
disobey they him in <em>anything</em>. O, sirs, how should
not the king be strongest, seeing that in such sort he
is obeyed? And he held his peace.</p>

<p>"Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of
truth (this was Zorobabel) began to speak: O,
sirs, is not the king great, and men are many, and
wine is strong; who is it then that ruleth them or
hath the lordship over them? Are they not women?
Women have borne the king and all the people that
bear rule by sea and land. Even of them came they:
and they nourished them up that planted the vineyards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
from whence the wine cometh. These also
make garments for men; these bring glory unto
men; and without women, cannot men be. Yea, and
if men have gathered together gold and silver and
every goodly thing, and see a woman which is comely
in favor and beauty, they let all those things go,
and gape after her, and even with open mouth fix
their eyes fast on her; and have all more desire unto
her than unto gold or silver or any goodly thing
whatsoever. A man leaveth his own father that
brought him up, and his own country, and cleaveth
unto his wife. And with his wife he endeth his
days, and remembereth neither father, nor mother,
nor country. By this also ye must know that women
have dominion over you. Do ye not labor and
toil and bring all to women? Yea, a man taketh
his sword, and goeth forth to make outroads, and
to rob and to steal, and to sail upon the sea and upon
rivers; and looketh upon a lion; and walketh in the
darkness.... Yea, many there be that have run
out of their wits for women, and become bondmen
for their sakes. Many also have perished, have
stumbled, and sinned, for women. O sirs, how can
it be but women should be strong, seeing they do
thus? Then the king and the nobles looked one upon
another: so he began to speak concerning truth. O
sirs, are not women strong? Great is the earth,
high is the heaven, swift is the sun in its course for
he compasseth the heavens round about and fetcheth
his course again to his own place in one day. Is he
not great that maketh these things? Therefore
great is truth and stronger than all things. All the
earth calleth upon truth, and the heaven blesseth
her: all works shake and tremble, but with her is no
unrighteous thing; wine is unrighteous, the king is
unrighteous, women are unrighteous, all the children
of men are unrighteous, and unrighteous are all
such their works; and there is no truth in them; in
their unrighteousness also shall they perish. But
truth abideth, and is strong forever; she liveth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
conquereth for evermore. With her there is no accepting
of persons or rewards; but she doeth the
things that are just and refraineth from all unrighteous
and wicked things; and all men do well like of
her works. Neither in her judgment is any unrighteousness;
and she is the strength, and the kingdom,
and the power, and the majesty of all ages. Blessed
be the God of truth. And with that he held his
tongue. And all the people then shouted and said,
Great is truth, and strong above all things."</p></blockquote>


<h4>II Esdras.</h4>

<p>II Esdras is an entirely separate work, originally
written in Hebrew. It consists of a series of visions of
the future of Jerusalem, but it also takes up profound
religious questions, as to why man is created to suffer
and sin. The answer it offers to these queries is the salvation
of the righteous after death. Its view of life is
severe and sad. Chapters i and ii and probably xv and
xvi are later editions by a Christian hand.</p>


<h4>Tobit.</h4>

<p>This is the story of the trials of a good man
(Tobit&mdash;Goodness) in the sad times of the overthrow of
Israel by Assyria. He "walked in truth and justice, fed
the hungry and clothed the naked" and was a strict observer
of every precept of the Jewish Law. A particular
duty he took upon himself in those gloomy days of warfare
was the giving decent burial to those of his brethren
slain in the battle-field&mdash;daring the tyrant's edict against
it. His property was confiscated, yet he remained undeterred
in fulfilling this holy obligation. It was through
this very duty, voluntarily undertaken, that he accidentally
lost his eyesight. But he never lost his faith in God.</p>

<p>The story now turns from the trials of a good man
to those of a good woman&mdash;Sara. The spirit of evil, Asmodeus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
slew her husband on the very day of her marriage.
Again her hand was sought in wedlock and again
her husband was snatched from her side. On seven occasions
this happened, making her the reproach of her
neighbors.</p>

<p>Now kind Providence intervenes to aid its faithful servants.
God sends the angel Raphael, who restores the
eyesight of Tobit and brings about a marriage between
his son Tobias and the much tried Sara. This time the
murderous scheme of Asmodeus is happily frustrated.
Tobit obtains his lost property and virtue is rewarded.</p>

<p>The following is a part of Tobit's prayer of thanksgiving:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And Tobit wrote a prayer for rejoicing, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed is God that liveth for ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blessed is His kingdom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he scourgeth, and sheweth mercy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He leadeth down to the grave, and bringeth up again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is none that shall escape his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give thanks unto Him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he hath scattered us among them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There declare His greatness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And extol Him before all the living:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because He is our Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God is our Father for ever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will again shew mercy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And will gather us out of all the nations among whom we are scattered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye turn to him with your whole heart, and with your whole soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do truth before him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then will He turn unto you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And will not hide His face from you,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And see what He will do with you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give him thanks with your whole mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bless the Lord of righteousness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exalt the Everlasting King.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, in the land of my captivity, give Him thanks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shew his strength and majesty to a nation of sinners.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn, ye sinners, and do righteousness before him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who can tell if he will accept you and have mercy on you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoice and be exceeding glad for the sons of the righteous:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they shall be gathered together and shall bless the Lord of the righteous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O blessed are they that love thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shall rejoice for Thy peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed are all they that sorrowed for all thy scourges:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they shall rejoice for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they have seen all Thy glory:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they shall me made glad forever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my soul bless God the great King.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Jerusalem shall be builded with sapphires and emeralds and precious stones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stones of Ophir.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all her streets shall say, Hallelujah, and give praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying, blessed is God, which hath exalted thee for ever."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>Judith.</h4>

<p>This is the story of a good and beautiful woman, who,
like Esther, saved Israel from a tyrant by stratagem
and bravery. Like Tobit, it lays stress on obedience to
the Law, of which deeds of kindness form a part. Hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
both belong to that period, whence so much emphasis
was placed on law enacted. Both Judith and Tobit might
be called historical romances.</p>


<h4>Additions to the
Book of Esther.</h4>

<p>These additions introduce the religious note lacking in
the biblical Esther, which does not even mention God. A
beautiful prayer is ascribed to Esther, in which she, as a
devout Jewess, opens her heart to the Lord.</p>


<h4>Wisdom Literature.</h4>

<p>If Syrian paganism showed the influence of the Greek
at his worst on Jewish morals, Ben Sirach and Wisdom
of Solomon are indications of the influence of Greek
thought at its best on Jewish thinkers. Together with
the Bible books of Proverbs, Job and Ecclesiastes, they
form a group called "Wisdom Literature." A large part
of both books is devoted to the value of wisdom, but it is
that wisdom the beginning of which is the fear of the
Lord.</p>


<h4>Ecclesiasticus.</h4>

<p>The Wisdom of Jesus (Greek for Joshua), Ben Sirach
or Ecclesiasticus is a commentary on the times. It was
written about <small>B.C.E.</small> 180, in Judea, before the persecution
began under Antiochus, the Syrian who was so little
Greek and so largely pagan. It urges obedience to the
Law and Commandments and gives copious rules of
conduct in every relation of life.</p>

<p>Ben Sirach was a Jewish scribe. Some of his sayings
are edited and some are original. Here are a few quotations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Woe to the sinner that goeth two ways.</p>

<p>Wine and music rejoice the heart, and the love of
wisdom is above both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom and
the prudence of sinners is not counsel.</p>

<p>They (the laboring class) maintain the fabric of
the world; and in the handiwork of their craft is
their prayer.</p>

<p>He that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten,
his offering is made a mockery.</p>

<p>As one that slayeth his neighbor is he that taketh
away his living.</p>

<p>As God's mercy is great, so is His correction also.</p>

<p>Before man is life and death, and whatsoever he
liketh shall be given to him.</p>

<p>There is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is
a shame that is glory and grace.</p>

<p>A slip on the pavement is better than a slip with
the tongue.</p>

<p>Depart from wrong and it shall turn aside from
thee.</p>

<p>He that keepeth the law bringeth offerings enough.</p>

<p>He that requiteth a good turn offereth fine flour.</p>

<p>If thou come to serve the Lord prepare for adversity.</p>

<p>Let not reverence of any man cause thee to fall.</p>

<p>Hide not thy wisdom in its beauty.</p>

<p>Rejoice not over the death of thy greatest enemy
but remember that we die all.</p>

<p>Forsake not an old friend, for the new is not comparable
to him.</p>

<p>Unto the slave that is wise shall they that are
free do service.</p>

<p>The bee is little among such as fly; but her fruit
is the chief of sweet things.</p>

<p>Judge none blessed before his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The rich man hath done wrong yet he threateneth
withal. The poor man is wronged and he must entreat
also.</p>

<p>Blessed is he whose conscience has not condemned
him.</p>

<p>He that despiseth small things by small things
shall he fall.</p>

<p>Wisdom that is hid and treasure that is hoarded,
what profit is there in both?</p>

<p>He that setteth a trap shall be taken therein.</p>

<p>He that revengeth shall find vengeance from
the Lord.</p>

<p>The stroke of the whip maketh marks in the flesh,
but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.</p></blockquote>


<h4>Wisdom of Solomon.</h4>

<p>The influence of Greek ideas on Ben Sirach is slight,
in Wisdom of Solomon it is pronounced. Indeed, this
latter book was written in Greek, in Alexandria, the centre
of Hellenist government. Its date is about 100 <small>B.C.E.</small>
Like most of the books of this collection, it is ascribed
to one of the great men of the Bible. Here King Solomon
exhorts the rulers of the earth to seek wisdom and
to shun idolatry. He expatiates on the influence of divine
wisdom on life as exemplified in the noble souls of
Israel's great past. Here are some extracts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Beware of murmuring which is unprofitable: and
refrain your tongue from back-biting: for there is
no word so secret that shall go for nought.</p>

<p>Honorable age is not that which standeth in length
of time, nor that is measured by number of years.</p>

<p>If riches be a possession to be desired in this life,
what is richer than wisdom that worketh all things.</p>

<p>Fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours
which reason offereth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>For these men (idolators) there is but small
blame, if they peradventure do but go astray while
they are seeking God and desiring Him.</p>

<p>Even if we sin, we are Thine. But we shall not
sin, knowing that we have been accounted Thine;
for to be acquainted with Thee is perfect righteousness.</p>

<p>Court not death in the error of thy life. God made
not death, nor delighteth He when the living perish,
for He created all things that they might have being.</p>

<p>Wisdom is the effulgence from everlasting light,
and the unspotted mirror of the working of God
and the image of His goodness.</p>

<p>
Surely vain are all men by nature who are ignorant of God,<br />
And could not out of the good things that are seen know Him that is:<br />
But deemed either fire or wind or the swift air,<br />
Or the circle of the stars, or the violent water, or the light of heaven,<br />
To be the gods which govern the world....<br />
For, if astonished at their power let them understand<br />
Through them how much mightier is He that made them....<br />
To know God is perfect righteousness,<br />
Yea, to know thy powers is the root of immortality.<br />
</p></blockquote>


<h4>Baruch.</h4>

<p class="noind">This is a general collection of four different writings.</p>

<p class="noind">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>


<h4>Song of the Three
Holy Children:</h4>

<p>These "children" are none other than the three young
men, who with Daniel dared the fiery furnace in testimony
of their faith. The song is presumed to have been
sung in the furnace. The book, then, is an amplification
of the Bible book of "Daniel." This amplification of
Scripture became more and more a favorite custom of the
rabbinic age. It is called <em>Agada</em>, i.e., story.</p>

<p>To quote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At this time there is neither prince, prophet nor
leader, burnt offering or place of sacrifice. Nevertheless,
in a contrite heart and a humble spirit let
us be accepted. Like as burnt offerings of bullocks
and thousands of fat lambs may our sacrifice be in
thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go
after thee. For they shall not be confounded who
put their trust in thee."</p></blockquote>


<h4>History of
Susanna.</h4>

<p>This is the story of a chaste woman whom wicked men
tried to betray. In the end both her purity and their sin
are discovered.</p>


<h4>Bel and the Dragon.</h4>

<p>Like "The Song of the Three Holy Children" this also
is an addition to the story of Daniel. It is an <em>expose</em> of
the hypocrisy of the priests of the Babylonian idol Bel.</p>


<h4>Prayer of Manasses.</h4>

<p>This is the Greek spelling of Manasseh, one of the last
Kings of Judah. It is a prayer ascribed to him in Babylonian
exile. This prayer might be introduced in the
confessions of the Day of Atonement.</p>


<h4>I and II Maccabees.</h4>

<p>The Books of the Maccabees are the classic authority
on the Maccabean uprising. The first Book gives a graphic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
picture of the struggle and the events that led up to
it. It is also our source for the subsequent events which
will be related in due course, carrying the narrative down
to 135 <small>B.C.E.</small> It is written from the strict standpoint of
the Chassidim. These, it will be remembered, were the
extremely pious party. It is couched in sober historic
style. Its value as authentic Jewish history cannot be
over-estimated. Written originally in Hebrew (or Aramaic),
it has come down to us unfortunately only in a
Greek translation.</p>

<p>The second Book of Maccabees was written in Greek
and is a condensation of a larger work. It confines itself
to the series of events between 175 and 160. Though
written in more ornate style, it is less reliable; but it contains
some interesting stories, such as the martyrdom of
Eleazer, Hannah and her seven sons. Like Daniel, it
is written to edify and inspire.</p>

<p>In most of the Apocryphal Books, the writers have but

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>IN THE DIASPORA.</h3>


<p>Having brought our story to the close of an epoch, we
will pause and glance at the status of the Jew in other
lands. The dispersion of Israel in a voluntary way had
already begun, though Judea was still the centre of gravity.
So the sway of the High Priest reached not only
to the Palestinian provinces&mdash;Ph&oelig;nicia, Samaria, Galilee,
Gilead, Edom and Philistia&mdash;but extended through parts
of Asia Minor and to lands on both banks of the Mediterranean
Sea. These lands of Jewish settlement outside
of Palestine are called the Diaspora.</p>


<h4>Egypt.</h4>

<p>The land that next to Judea contained the largest number
of Jews was Egypt. Our narrative has been moving
to and fro between these two lands. In no country outside
of Greece itself was the Greek spirit so completely
diffused as in Egypt. Alexandria, its new capital, displacing
Athens as the intellectual centre of the world,
was second in importance only to Rome. While the
Greek civilization at its worst was tinctured with an enervated
orientalism and had much in it debasing, yet the
Greek spirit at its best also found its way to Alexandria,
and its influence was intellectually broadening and elevating
on the Jews resident there. Look back to Chapter
ii.</p>

<p>Under this Greek regime the Jews were given equality
at least officially, in Egypt, and also in Cyrene (on the
coast of the adjoining country, Lybia). The Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Egyptian royal house was called the Ptolemaic, from
Ptolemy, the family name of its kings. Ptolemy Philometer
was a contemporary of Antiochus Epiphanes, and
many Jews fled from Palestine to take refuge under his
benevolent sway. What a contrast for Israel between
Egypt under the Ptolemies and Egypt under the Pharaohs
a thousand years earlier!</p>

<p>When settling in lands where they would find themselves
a small minority, Jews have usually concentrated
in large cities. This has been a source both of strength
and of weakness. <em>Of strength</em>&mdash;for when scattered in
twos and threes in country places, the maintenance of
their religion and their historic consciousness would become
imperilled; while numbers closely grouped offer
power of achievement. Cities too, are the intellectual
centres of a land. <em>Of weakness</em>&mdash;for city dwellers lose
the simplicity that goes with country life in close contact
with nature, which deepens faith; and work on the
soil in the open, aids in the building of character. So
here, in a land outside of Israel, we find Jews settling in
one of the great cities of the world.</p>

<p>The Delta, an Alexandrian district on the sea-coast,
was wholly a Jewish colony. The Jews participated in
both the commercial and intellectual activities of this famous
capital of antiquity. They exported grain, formed
artisan guilds, and established schools which were also
their synagogues.</p>


<h4>The Septuagint.</h4>

<p>Interest in Israel was further manifested in its hearty
endorsement of the translation of the Jewish Scriptures
into Greek given by Ptolemy Philadelphus. But this
translation was made first and chiefly for the Jews themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Hebrew was growing more and more of a strange
tongue to the new generation in Alexandria and its surroundings.
Even in Palestine proper they no longer
spoke Hebrew, but Aramaic, a sister tongue. A translation
of the Bible had already been made in this language;
it is called Targum. Indeed, the books of Daniel
and Ezra are written in Aramaic; so are some of the
prayers in our ritual.</p>

<p>This Greek translation was made, secondly, for the
Greeks. It gave the desired opportunity to the Jews to
explain their faith and literature to the people with whom
they were now brought in friendly contact, and would
silence the slanders of ill-wishers such as the Egyptian
priest Manetho.</p>

<p>At first only the Pentateuch was translated, each book
being assigned to a different scholar. A pretty story that
we must not take too seriously says it was entrusted to
seventy-two persons, six from each tribe. The tradition
survives partly in name&mdash;Septuagint&mdash;(seventy), written
lxx. The anniversary of this really great event was
commemorated by the Jews as a holiday. We may say
that this translation of our Scripture into this widely
spoken tongue was the beginning of the mission of the
Jew to carry God's Law to the Gentiles. The Greeks
were among the great educators of the world. Now that
the Bible was revealed in their tongue, it became the
property of the world and its lessons reached the hearts
of many, scattered far and wide.</p>


<h4>Onias and
His Temple.</h4>

<p>Onias, son of the Jewish High Priest of the same name,
was the most renowned of the Judean settlers in Alexandria.
He was entrusted with an army in one of Philometer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
campaigns. He was likewise chosen by the Judeans
of Egypt as their Ethnarch (governor), to direct
the affairs of the Jewish community. Around him the
people coalesced into a strong body.</p>

<p>He conceived the idea of building a Temple for the
benefit of the Alexandrian Jews whom distance practically
debarred from the benefits of the Temple in Jerusalem.
If justified at all, the right to establish it was most naturally
his as heir of the High Priest at Jerusalem. Yet it
was a bold step, a daring precedent, since only one sanctuary,
that at Jerusalem, had been recognized since the
days of Josiah. Such was the law. (See Deut. xii, verses
13-15.) The new Temple was, not unnaturally, condemned
by the Jews of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>We might say, if it was a daring innovation, it was
abundantly justified by the changed conditions. The Deuteronomy
law was of great value at the time instituted, in
preventing the spread of idolatrous notions through the
ministrations of ignorant village priests; but "new occasions
bring new duties;" that was no longer to be feared.
Again, the two-and-a-half tribes in the days of Joshua
(see Josh. xxii) offered a precedent in building a
second altar, when nothing but the Jordan separated them
from the rest of Israel. Lastly, it was almost a realization
of the exquisite Messianic picture in Isaiah xix, 19-25,
where an altar would be built in Egypt, and Israel,
Assyria and Egypt would be united under God's blessing.</p>

<p>So built it was, at Leontopolis, in old Goshen, land of
early Israel's sojourn, and near the famous Memphis. It
received royal sanction and aid; but it never acquired for
Egyptian Jews the validity and sanction of the Temple
at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Philometer's confidence was further shown in appointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Onias Arab-arch, i.e., commander of the Arabian
province Heliopolis, and also custodian of the Nile ports.</p>

<p>In the following pages we shall see Egypt gradually
losing power and independence through the growth of
Rome; but we will notice also that through all these
changes the status of the Jews remains almost undisturbed&mdash;that
unfriendly attacks are confined almost wholly to
literary slanders. But then, grave persecutions often began
with the pen throughout all Israel's history.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>PHARISEES AND SADDUCEES.</h3>


<h4>Simon.</h4>

<p>The new kingdom acquired <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de jure</i> (by treaty), must
yet be fought for to be maintained <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</i>. The citadel
of Jerusalem, as well as that key to the mountain passes,
Gazara, had still to be mastered. Successful in both enterprises,
Israel could enjoy some years of long needed
peace. Simon furthered the religious as well as the political
welfare of his country. The people could till their
ground in peace and for a time at least "sit under their
own vine and their own fig-tree"; though it could not
yet be said "there was none to fray them away." Simon,
moreover, "strengthened those who had been brought
low, the Law he searched out, and he beautified the sanctuary."
He used the time of quiet for building a haven
at Joppa, for enlarging the boundaries and for encouraging
agriculture.</p>

<p>The office of High Priest, maintained hitherto in a hereditary
priestly family, had been gradually transferred to
the Hasmonean House, and hence now devolved on Simon.
By this time the people had become reconciled to
the transfer. He renewed the treaty with Rome, which
had taken the place of Greece in becoming the greatest
power in the world and in deciding the fate of nations.</p>

<p>When Tryphon was slain, Antiochus turned against
the Jews, but was defeated by Simon's sons. Alas, Simon's
fate was not to be an exception to that of the rest of
his warrior brothers. None died a peaceful death. Simon,
together with two of his sons, was treacherously slain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
by his own son-in-law, Ptolemy, an unscrupulous man,
cruelly ambitious for the throne.</p>


<h4>Hyrcanus I</h4>

<p>John Hyrcanus, the oldest surviving son of Simon,
became the next Jewish ruler. So, imperceptibly a royal
house had been created, and the princely honor came to
Hyrcanus by <em>hereditary succession</em>. In just that way
have all royal lines been created&mdash;starting with a great
deliverer, like Judas Maccabee. But the <em>title</em>, King, came
later. Hyrcanus had not only to rout the usurper Ptolemy
before the rulership could become his, but had also
to resist the siege of Antiochus VII., the next Syrian
king, who would not yet renounce Judea without another
struggle. Peace was at last reached by Hyrcanus agreeing
to the payment of an indemnity and tribute for a few
outlying towns.</p>

<p>This first repulse showed that the new kingdom was
not very strong and that it owed its independence to Syrian
weakness (due to the continued conflicts of rivals and
pretenders), rather than to its own material power. But
Syria's embarrassment was Judah's opportunity. After
Antiochus had been slain in a Parthian conflict, John
Hyrcanus, once secure, began a vigorous campaign to
enlarge his boundaries. Very soon he had incorporated
the old land of the Ten Tribes, now called Samaria. The
complete conquest of the Samaritans was undertaken toward
the end of his life. Their famous temple on Mount
Gerizim was destroyed. Idumea (Edom) was also conquered
and Judaism imposed on it by force. But that
kind of conversion was always against the free and tolerant
spirit of Judaism and against its very genius. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
shall later see that it brought its own retribution and
weakened the cause of Israel.</p>


<h4>Pharisees and
Sadducees.</h4>

<p>Let us not forget that the rise of the Hasmoneans had
come about in a measure through a conflict for religious
integrity between the extreme pietists on the one hand,
the Chassidim, and the worldly Hellenists on the other,
with varied shades of opinion in between. These religious
divergences had now crystallized into two schools
that acquired the names Pharisees and Sadducees. It
is hard to say just when these distinctions began. Perhaps
they were always there; for we meet the two groups&mdash;conservative
and progressive&mdash;under different names in
all creeds and in nearly all eras. The division is naturally
inherent in the human temperament. It marks broadly
the two grand divisions into which all men become grouped
in organized society.</p>

<p>Now let us consider in particular the distinctions that
differentiated these two parties in the Jewish State. The
Sadducees were largely composed of the priestly families;
but the priestly caste was not necessarily the religious
class. It corresponded rather to what we would call the
aristocracy&mdash;we have seen that the High Priest was also
a prince. In this party, too, were largely the military.
They were faithful to the Mosaic Law, the Pentateuch,
which they rigorously enforced, but gave slight allegiance
to the later religious injunctions that came to be developed
from the Law by the Scribes; in so far they were religiously
unprogressive. Still in their attitude toward life in
general, they did not approve of holding aloof from the
world, but encouraged a mingling with it and entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
into intimate commercial and political relations with other
nations. They regarded it their patriotic duty to aggrandize
the nation in every way and to make it a splendid
power.</p>

<p>The name Sadducee is derived from Zadok, of the
family of Aaron, the chief priest of the time of Solomon's
Temple, who thus gave his name to the priestly house,
"Sons of Zadok."</p>

<p>The Pharisees, while interpreting Biblical law more
leniently in certain respects than the Sadducees, were determined
supporters of all the mass of legal minutiæ that
had been evolved from the Law proper and which had become
a "Second Law." These rites and ceremonies that
were added to the original Mosaic code (occasionally by
a rather forced deduction) they considered equally binding
with it. They called it the <em>Oral Law</em> to distinguish it
from the <em>Written Law</em>, and the tradition was that it, too,
was revealed to Moses.</p>

<p>In their political policy they equally diverged from the
Sadducees, believing in standing somewhat apart from
the peoples about them. They looked askance upon too
intimate relations with the world at large; for they believed
it their duty to subordinate all interests, national
and commercial, to the religious, trusting the outcome
rather to divine providence than to the judgment of their
statesmen or the enterprise of energetic leaders.</p>

<p>Further, as against the priestly aristocracy, that wished
to confine all ecclesiastical functions to the priestly order,
the Pharisees were more democratic in that they desired
to extend the privileges of priestly sanctification and holiness
to all. Purifying ablutions, they claimed, were obligatory
on the whole people. <em>Their</em> meals should also be
consecrated, even as the repasts of the priests&mdash;so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
all Israel should be a "Kingdom of priests and a holy
nation." Hence, "Second Maccabees," the work of a
Pharisee, declares, "Unto <em>all</em> are given the heritage, the
kingdom, the priesthood and the sanctuary."</p>

<p>The chief characteristics of the Pharisees are expressed
in their name: <em>Pharash</em>, the Law expounders; <em>Pharash</em>,
the separatists&mdash;though the former is probably its true
derivation.</p>

<p>The Pharisees, it will be seen, were the more pious,
the Sadducees the more worldly, though the Pharisees as
a whole were not as pious as the Chassidim had been,
nor the Sadducees as worldly as the Hellenists had
been. The Sadducees further denied belief in bodily resurrection
or in judgment after death (though not necessarily
renouncing immortality), on the strength of the
famous teaching of Antigonus of Socho, "Be not as servants
who serve the Master for the sake of reward, but
rather as those who serve the Master without thought
of reward." As distinct from the Pharisees they were
strong believers in free-will, that the destiny of men is
in their own hands. We might call the Sadducees the
rationalists and the Pharisees traditionalists.</p>

<p>Some Pharisees again did carry the fulfilment of rites
and ceremonies too far; a few, perhaps, were even ostentatious
in their piety. By strange mischance these few
have transferred their dubious reputation to all Pharisees
as such. Most unjustly however, for the Pharisees earned
the confidence of the great bulk of the people and were
on the whole identified with them. So strangely has that
sinister repute persisted that "Pharisee" is to-day defined
in some dictionaries as self-righteous or hypocritical (see
note). How undeserved as describing those whose trust
in God was absolute, without reservation or misgiving.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
This is but one of many instances where the world's verdict
has been unjust to the Jew.</p>


<h4>Essenes.</h4>

<p>We meet also a third party nearer in sympathy to the
Pharisees. The old Chassidim, the extremists, had developed
into an ascetic party under the name of <em>Essenes</em>,
with a similar meaning&mdash;pious. They lived the life of a
celibate brotherhood, holding the little they allowed themselves,
in common. They hardly affected the national
life of Israel, because they were too few and because they
slighted patriotic obligations. They practiced all the self-denial
of the Nazirites of old and sought to reach from
cleanliness to godliness. Another derivation of the name
Essene is "bather," baptist, from their frequent ablutions.
Yet another is "healer."</p>

<p>The Hasmonean royalty&mdash;to what party did they belong?
Well, we might say that they began their career
with all the religious enthusiasm of the Pharisees, they
closed it with the political outlook of the Sadducees. This
was something like an anti-climax.</p>

<p>John Hyrcanus perhaps represents the dividing line.
He started on a career of conquest simply to satisfy national
ambition; though he had forced Judaism on the
Idumeans. In his later years, he rejected many traditional
observances of the Oral Law that completed his estrangement
from the Pharisees. Taking a material and external
survey, Hyrcanus left the Jews at the end of his life with
an independent State, that in power and extent was as
great as Northern Israel in its palmy days, as great perhaps
as the realm of Solomon. He could mint his own
coins, on some of which, still in existence, we find inscribed,
"Jochanan, High Priest of the Commonwealth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Judeans." Yes, it was all very splendid! But surely the
Jews had learned by now the insufficiency of national
glory that was material and external, that that kind of
splendor was apart from the Jewish ideal, "not by might,
not by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord." The age
needed a Jeremiah again. Alas, the era of the Prophets
was over!</p>

general condemnation in literature.</p>

<p>The Talmud is also bitter against the false Pharisees,
the <em>Zebuim</em>, the tainted ones, who do evil like Zimri and
claim the goody reward like Phineas. In its severe denunciation
of the false Pharisees, it divides them into
six classes:</p>

<p>1. Those who do the will of God for earthly motives.
2. The ostentatious who go with slow steps and say "Wait
for me, I have a good deed to perform." 3. Those who
knock their heads against a wall because in their looking
up they fear they may see a woman. 4. Those who pose
as saints. 5. Those who say, "Tell me of another duty."

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>A ROYAL HOUSE AGAIN.</h3>


<h4>Aristobulus.</h4>

<p>In Aristobulus, eldest son and successor of John
Hyrcanus, we see the Hasmonean further and further
estranged from the generous spirit that called them to the
fore. Judas Maccabeus wished to be the <em>Saviour</em> of
Judaism and the Jews, Aristobulus wanted only to be their
<em>king</em>. The story of Abimelech in the days of the Judges
and Jotham's parable come forcibly to mind (Judges ix).
Aristobulus began his reign by inprisoning his mother, to
prevent her succession to the throne, according to his
father's wish, and likewise all his brothers but one, on
suspicion of their treason. Antigonus was his favorite
brother, and he shared the royal power with him. The
king was certainly unpopular with the people, who accused
him of being more Greek than Jew. Slander made
him even worse than he was, ascribing to him the death
of his beloved brother Antigonus, who was assassinated
toward the close of his reign. He continued his father's
policy of conquest, and subdued portions of northern Palestine,
including Galilee, and, like his father again imposed
Judaism upon them. While in both instances the
motive for the forced conversion was probably ancestral
pride, still it showed religious zeal too&mdash;though not of the
highest kind.</p>


<h4>Alexander Janneus.</h4>

<p>The widow of Aristobulus, Salome Alexandra, released
her husband's brother from prison at his death and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
marrying Alexander Janneus, the eldest, and appointing
him to the office of High Priest she allowed the kingly
power to devolve upon him. Like his brother, he was
not a man of peace, but of war. He further increased
Judea's territory by conquest on the western Philistine
side bordering on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>He was not the man to quiet the growing dissensions
between Pharisees and Sadducees, but rather to foment
them. For the royal Sadducean party was getting more
and more estranged in policy and aim from the national
and religious aspirations of the people. There was a
not always silent protest against the warrior king
officiating as High Priest. At the Feast of Tabernacles,
the people pelted him with their citrons, which
they were carrying together with palms (<em>lulab and
esrog</em>), symbols of the harvest, for this is also called
the Feast of Ingathering. This could not end without
a tragedy, and a large number were slain by his foreign
mercenaries. (Royal body guards were usually composed
of foreigners.) This conflict grew into a civil war,
both sides in turn hiring foreign troops, and resulted in
a terrible decimating of Judah's numbers, the Pharisees
losing more largely. Such is one of the evils of uniting
religious authority with temporal power. The rebellion
was finally put down, but only with an iron hand.</p>

<p>This king, who could not be at peace, spent his last
days in fighting the Arabians, who were just beginning
to be Judea's most dangerous neighbor. But he inherited
from his Maccabean ancestors love of arms without
inheriting their military genius. This meant much
wanton waste of life and some reverses. How vain
this purpose of spending blood and substance in extending
his territorial sway and making it nominally Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
by force of arms, while fomenting religious antagonism
at home&mdash;always destructive of religion itself. He left
an even bigger State than his father, John Hyrcanus.
Judea now meant the whole seacoast (with the exception
of Ascalon) from Mount Carmel to Egypt and reached
far east of the Jordan.</p>


<h4>Queen Salome Alexandra.</h4>

<p>The throne went by will to Alexander Janneus'
widow, who, it will be remembered, was also the widow
of his elder brother, Aristobulus. Upon her eldest son,
Hyrcanus, Queen Salome bestowed the high priesthood.
Her sympathies, however, were entirely with the Pharisees.
The exiles came back and political prisoners were
released. The land enjoyed a pleasing contrast under
her pious and gentle sway. All the Pharisaic ordinances,
abolished by the late king, were reinstituted. Indeed,
all religious interests were placed in their hands.
It was a prosperous, peaceful reign, and was later looked
back upon as a blessed day. In the stormy days that were
to follow, it might well seem in retrospect, a golden age.</p>

</div>


<h4>The "Pairs."</h4>

<p>We have seen that the priesthood and Temple were no
longer the religious centres around which the people
rallied. The Jews had outgrown the age of priestism,
although the splendid ritual of the sacrificial altar still
continued. The religious guides and teachers were the
scribes, learned in the Law, who for sometime had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
presiding in couples. Hence they are called the "Pairs."
The first of each pair held the office of <em>Nasi</em>, Prince or
President of the Sanhedrin, and the second that of <em>Ab
Beth Din</em>, Father of the Court or Vice-President.</p>

<p>Here are their names with some of the most famous
sayings attributed to them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Jose ben Joezer</em>&mdash;Let thy house be a meeting
place for the wise. Cover thyself with the dust of
their feet and quench thy thirst with their words.</p>

<p><em>Jose ben Jochanan</em>&mdash;Let thy house be opened wide
and let the needy be thy household.</p>

<p><em>Joshua ben Perachia</em>&mdash;Procure for thyself an instructor,
possess thyself of a worthy associate, and
judge every man in the scale of merit.</p>

<p><em>Mattai the Arbelite</em>&mdash;Associate not with the wicked
and flatter not thyself that thou canst evade punishment.</p>

<p><em>Jehudah ben Tabbai</em>&mdash;Constitute not thyself dictator
to the Judges.</p>

<p><em>Simon ben Shetach</em>&mdash;Be guarded in thy words;
perchance from them men may learn to lie.</p>

<p><em>Shemaiah</em>&mdash;Love labor and hate pomp and suffer
thyself to remain unknown to the head of the State.</p>

<p><em>Abtalion</em>&mdash;Ye wise be guarded in your words; or
you may be exiled to a place of evil waters (false
doctrine) and your disciples may drink and die.</p>

<p><em>Hillel</em> and <em>Shammai</em>, the last "Pair," will be treated in
a separate chapter.</p></blockquote>

<p>Simon ben Shetach flourished in this reign. He
was brother-in-law of the king, by whom he had been
nevertheless imprisoned. But when the queen came to
the throne he was practically placed as the religious head
of affairs. Simon ben Shetach and his associate, Judah
ben Tabbai, reorganized the Council and hence were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
called "restorers of the Law." From this time on the Pharisaic
became the official interpretation of Judaism.</p>

<p>In all large towns Simon ben Shetach established
schools for young men for the study of the Pentateuch
and the laws interpreted from it. As President of the
Council, he was very severe on those who infringed on
the law. He has even been called the Judean Brutus, as
he did not spare his own son. He reinstituted many
customs that had been neglected during the Sadducean
regime. Among these was the joyous "Water Celebration"
during Tabernacles, a trace of which still survives
in the ritual of <em>Shemini Atzereth</em> (the eighth day
that follows and concludes the festival of Succoth). The
celebrations were accompanied by illuminations and
torchlight processions, religious music and dancing.
The water drawing at the Spring of Siloah was heralded
by blasts of the priests' trumpets. Another national custom
revived was the summer "Wood Festival," on Ab
15. It had relation to the use of wood at the altar fires,
and was a further opportunity for joyous unbending
among the youths and maidens.</p>

<p>The Pharisees on the whole were the more democratic
party, and decided that the maintenance of the
Temple should be borne by all and not merely by voluntary
offerings of the rich few. This new law brought
enormous revenues to the Temple which later became
its menace, attracting the covetous rather than the worshipful.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>RIVAL CLAIMANTS FOR THE THRONE.</h3>


<h4>Aristobulus II.</h4>

<p>Even before the good Queen Salome died storm
clouds began to darken the horizon of Judah. Her second
son, Aristobulus, inherited all his father's fierceness
and tyranny. The throne had been naturally left to the
elder brother, Hyrcanus, but the headstrong Aristobulus
seized the reins of power on the dangerous theory that
he was more fit to rule. Civil war began before the good
queen had quite breathed her last. Hyrcanus, the weak,
yielded, and all might have been well were it not for the
interference of a new enemy who was eventually to
bring about the ruin of the Jewish State.</p>


<h4>Antipater
the Idumean.</h4>

<p>It will be recalled that John Hyrcanus had conquered
the Idumeans and made them, seemingly, Jews. We shall
now see the kind of Jews they were. One of them, Antipater,
was the local governor of this Idumean province.
He was a man who lusted for power and had absolutely
no scruples as to the means of gaining his ends. He saw
that if only he could place the weak Hyrcanus on the
throne, he might become a power behind it.</p>

<p>He began by insinuating himself into the favor of the
Jewish nobility, and, ostensibly, as a pleader for justice,
emphasized the evils of Aristobulus' usurpation. Letting
that poison work, he came to the innocent Hyrcanus and
played upon his fears with a made-up story of conspiracy
against his life. Most reluctantly was Hyrcanus persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to flee with him from Jerusalem to an Arabian
prince, Aretas. Aretas was induced to lend his aid in
the expectation that Hyrcanus, once in power, would
restore the cities Alexander Janneus had taken from the
Arabians.</p>

<p>So unhappy Judah was plunged in war again to gratify
the unworthy ambitions of unworthy men and men not of
their own people. Aristobulus was defeated in battle by
Aretas and was besieged in the Temple Citadel.</p>


<h4>Prayer of Onias.</h4>

<p>An interesting incident is told at this juncture that recalls
the Bible story of Balaam. (Numbers xxii-xxiv.)
In the party of Hyrcanus there was a man, Onias, who,
so said credulous rumor, had brought rain in times of
drought through his fervent prayer. He was now brought
into the camp and asked to invoke God's curse on Aristobulus
and his allies. But such prayer he considered
blasphemous, therefore he voiced his petition to heaven
in these words: "O God, King of the whole world,
since those that stand now with me are Thy people and
those that are besieged are also Thy priests, I beseech
Thee that Thou wilt neither hearken to the prayer of
those against these, nor bring about what these pray
against those." Alas, the temper of warfare had not
patience or appreciation with this sublime attitude. The
man was stoned. But in a sense his prayer was answered.</p>


<h4>Pompey Takes
Jerusalem.</h4>

<p>For the Aesop fable of the two bears quarrelling over
a find, thus affording opportunity for a third to step in
and seize it, was here to be exemplified. Rome was ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
on the watch to bring all outlying provinces into her net.
Pompey, her victorious general, whose head Julius Caesar
was later to demand, was just now making his triumphant
march through Asia. The warring brothers, Hyrcanus
and Aristobolus, appealed to his lieutenant. To
leave the decision with Rome was a dangerous precedent,
for the power that could grant a throne by its decision
might also take it away. So, while the decision was
rendered in favor of Aristobulus, it was as vassal rather
than as independent king that he held his throne for
some two years. The real gainer was Rome. It had
now the right to revoke its decision; and it did. The
people, disgusted with their unworthy leaders who cared
nothing for the nation, but only for its honors&mdash;appealed
to Rome to abolish the monarchy that had been gradually
introduced and restore the old regime of the High
Priesthood.</p>

<p>But the headstrong Aristobulus dared resist even Rome
and entrenched himself against invasion. This was fatal
both for him and Judea. The temple mount was besieged.
It was taken with frightful massacre by lustful
Romans. This was in 63. Pompey sacrilegiously entered
the Holy of Holies, in which to his surprise he found no
idol; a spiritual God was an unfamiliar concept to the
pagan mind. He curtailed the Jewish state and made it
tributary. Aristobulus must grace Pompey's triumph at
Rome.</p>

<p>So much for the vain conquests of John Hyrcanus
and Alexander Janneus. They evaporated with a word
from Pompey. Thus ended the Judean independence
for which the early Maccabees had fought so nobly. It
had endured but seventy-nine years. Over this tributary
State Hyrcanus II. was made High Priest. The kingship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
created by the first Aristobulus was short-lived indeed.
The scheming Antipater had won, but graver issues
were to be the outcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">&nbsp;</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>JUDEA UNDER ROMAN SUZERAINTY.</h3>


<h4>Growth of Rome.</h4>

<p>Rome, from the city on the Tiber, had spread over
all Italy. Then gradually it mastered the lands on both
sides of the Mediterranean. Greece and Carthage were
absorbed in the same year, 146 <small>B.C.E.</small> Soon its tide of
conquest reached Asia, and nearly all the lands in the
East conquered by Alexander&mdash;excepting Persia&mdash;were
under its sway. When Greco Syria&mdash;which had included
Judea until the Maccabean independence&mdash;fell before
its arms, it was to be expected that the never-satisfied
Rome would not rest until the land of our fathers had
been added to its possessions. We have seen how an unhappy
series of events played into its hands and hastened
this end. In a sense Rome was becoming the "mistress
of the world." Nor was her sway as transitory as that
of earlier world powers&mdash;Assyria, Babylonia, Persia or
Macedonia. It was to endure for many centuries and it
has left a lasting impress upon the world's civilization.</p>

<p>Already the Jewish captives that Pompey took to
Rome, later freed and called Libertini, formed together
with earlier emigrants the beginnings of an important
Jewish community. Here later still we find this Jewish
colony on the Tiber quietly influencing Roman affairs.</p>

<p>Judea, with the rest of Palestine, was now placed under
the general supervision of Rome's Syrian governor.
Internally its life was not interfered with, but all temporal&mdash;that
is political&mdash;power was taken from the High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Priest. His authority was confined to the Temple. Both
Aristobulus, who had escaped from Rome, and his son,
Alexander, made foolhardy attempts for the throne,
which only resulted in further curtailing of Judah's power.
Yet another desperate attempt was made for the
throne. Alas, it only resulted in thirty thousand of the
defeated malcontents being sold into slavery. This chafing
against Rome's rule only brought its mailed hand
more fiercely against ill-fated Israel.</p>


<h4>From First Triumvirate
to Empire.</h4>

<p>But Rome now entered upon its own period of civil
war at home and men lustful of power drenched this
country in blood. In 60 <small>B. C. E.</small> Julius Caesar, Pompey and
Crassus divided the Roman possessions between them
and formed the First Triumvirate (Crassus given Syria,
plundered the Temple treasures). On the death of Crassus,
Caesar, ambitious for supreme power&mdash;the fatal
weakness of this really great man&mdash;crossed the river
Rubicon that was the boundary of his province of Gaul,
made war on Pompey, who was soon slain, and held for
a brief time sole sway. In 44 Caesar was killed by Brutus
and Cassius. These in turn were overthrown by Cæsar's
avenger, Marc Antony, and a new Triumvirate was
formed, consisting of Antony, Octavian (Augustus) and
Lepidus. These were as disloyal to each other as the
first group. Antony, seduced from his duty by the
witchery of that fatally beautiful woman, Cleopatra of
Egypt, was finally defeated and overthrown in the battle
of Actium, 30. Octavian Augustus now held the reins
alone and the <em>Roman Empire</em> was launched. Augustus,
the first emperor, reigned from 60 <small>B.C.E.</small> to 14 <small>A.C.E.</small><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">&nbsp;</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>These few outlines of Roman history will have to be
kept in mind to follow events in Judea, for much was
to happen to storm-tossed Israel between the first Triumvirate
and the empire of Augustus. Every change in
government at Rome affected the land of Israel and its
people.</p>

<p>Indeed, in all their subsequent history no great event
occurred in the world without affecting the Jews in some
way, and many of these world events were in turn influenced
by them.</p>

<p>When Pompey was killed in 48, that arch-conspirator,
Antipater, who had sided with him while in power, now
with Hyrcanus, his puppet, professed friendship for
Caesar and helped him with Jewish troops for his Egyptian
campaign. Caesar extended favors to both. Hyrcanus,
as High Priest, was once more given political
authority, and Antipater was made Procurator of Judea.
We have witnessed the thin entering of the wedge; behold
the Idumean now head of Jewish affairs. Caesar now
granted permission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,
and concessions and privileges were also conferred on
the Jews of Alexandria and Asia Minor, for Rome's sway
reached far. Caesar's good will made the rulership of
Antipater tolerable for a while and when the news of
Caesar's death reached the Jews they mourned him as
a lost friend.</p>

<p>The political power granted to Hyrcanus as High
Priest carried with it the title of Ethnarch, which means
governor of a province. But all power was really exercised
by Antipater who, as Procurator of Judea, made
his son Phasael governor of Jerusalem, and his son
Herod governor of Galilee. How this intruding stranger
had tightened his grip on the land of our fathers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>


<h4>Herod Enters
on the Scene.</h4>

<p>Herod was to play an important role in Judah's fortunes.
Already as governor of Galilee, a youth of
twenty-five, he showed his masterfulness in the summary
execution of a marauder. Summoned to the
Sanhedrin to answer for this action, he dared defy it.
Why? Because Cassius, now master of Syria (including
Judea) at Caesar's death, was put under obligation by the
crafty Antipater and his equally cunning son Herod.
Together they succeeded in squeezing money from Judæa
for the maintenance of an army against Antony. Thus
the Jews were embroiled in Rome's conflicts to further
the ambitions of these Idumeans. As a result Herod
was now made governor of Celo-Syria (Palestine) and
could snap his fingers at the Sanhedrin. Judea, in fact,
was a prey to anarchy brought about by conspiracies
and usurpations.</p>

<p>In 42 Brutus and Cassius were defeated at Philippi
by Antony and Octavian, and it seemed that an end
had come to the fortunes of Herod. Antipater had been
slain, caught in a final act of heartless duplicity against
Hyrcanus. But Herod had the adroit cunning of his
father and knew how to desert a sinking ship and change
his allegiance to the man of rising fortunes. With
plausible words Herod made his peace with Antony. Nor
did the complaints against him and his brother by the
Jewish nobility avail. On the contrary Antony made
them both <em>tetrarchs</em>&mdash;subordinate governors&mdash;of Judea
at the expense of the weak and aging Hyrcanus.</p>


<h4>The Last Hasmonean
Ruler.</h4>

<p>Antigonus, a son of Aristobulus, taking advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of a Parthian uprising, made one more effort to seize
the Jewish throne. He succeeded. Herod was put to
flight and Hyrcanus deposed altogether. This last scion
of the Hasmonean house held a brief royal sway from
40 to 37. He lacked the greatness of the earlier Maccabeans
to hold the nation; and, antagonized the Sanhedrin
instead of attaching it to him. Herod, after varied
shifts, sailed to Rome, making an appeal at headquarters.
Deceiving all by his plausibility, he obtained
an appointment as "King of Judea" from Antony's
senate. But for that throne he must now fight "the man
in possession." There followed a series of engagements
in which Jewish blood flowed freely. With the aid of
Rome, Herod was of course successful, ultimately taking
Jerusalem itself. Antigonus was put to death. Thus
ended the Hasmonean rule in Judea so gloriously begun
a little over a century before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>HEROD.</h3>


<p>What had been the result of the attempt of Alexander
Janneus to force Judaism upon Idumea? It had begun
by giving the Idumean Antipater, from the intimate
relations created, the opportunity to make Hyrcanus
his puppet, and ended by placing the Jewish crown upon
the head of Herod, who was absolutely un-Jewish in ancestry
and sympathies, and really a pagan at heart.
Herod, in fact, delivered Judea to Rome that he might
be made its vassal king.</p>

<p>He had married Mariamne, the beautiful grand
daughter of the weak Hyrcanus&mdash;a stroke of policy, to
be allied in marriage to Judah's royal family.</p>


<h4>Herod as Man.</h4>

<p>Undoubtedly he was a man of power of a sort, born
to command; but there was no soft spot in his nature. He
had all the instincts of a tyrant, and neither scruple nor
pity deterred him from carrying out his passionate will
and his insatiable ambition. He inherited all his father's
cunning, allied with fine judgment and untiring energy.
Though of undoubted bravery, he knew how to fawn
before those in power.</p>

<p>The first dozen years of his reign were marked by
storm and conflict with enemies both without and within.
The feelings of the Jews can be imagined in having this
alien thrust upon them by all-powerful Rome and whose
first act was to slay their patriots and confiscate their
property. Rebellion was put down with a merciless hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Step by step he carried out his relentless purpose and
put to death all the survivors of the royal line, the flower
of the Jewish nobility, and likewise every member (except
Shemaiah and Abtalion) of the Sanhedrin that had some
years before censured one of his misdeeds.</p>

<p>Very unwillingly he appointed his wife's brother
as High Priest. It was a fatal distinction for the young
man, for the people too openly expressed their regard
for this scion of the Hasmonean line. What was the
consequence? One day when refreshing himself in
the bath, he was held under the water till life was extinct.
It was called an accident! Alexandra, his mother,
a hard woman, appealed to Rome through Cleopatra
to punish this murder. Herod was summoned to answer
for his conduct before Antony, but his plausible manner
aided by bribery won his acquittal. The tyrant marked
his return by the execution of another brother-in-law,
to whom he had entrusted Mariamne in his absence, and
whom he jealously imagined disloyal.</p>

<p>That Antony at this time gave part of Palestine proper
to Cleopatra, including even a bit of Judea, and that
Herod must bear it without protest, showed on what
slender tenure he held his throne. So completely was he
under Rome's control that Antony, to satisfy the whim
of Cleopatra who disliked Herod, commanded him to
undertake a campaign against the Arabians, while she
secretly assisted them.</p>

<p>When Antony fell at Actium in 31 in that contest
between continents, Herod managed adroitly at the
right moment to go over to the side of the victorious
Octavian Augustus. Before departing for Rome to curry
favor with the Emperor, he took a precaution, which
only his cruelty deemed necessary. He put to death his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
own kinsman, the aged Hyrcanus, to whose weakness
he in a measure owed his throne.</p>

<p>He returned in the good graces of Augustus, and
received back all the lands taken from him by Antony
for Cleopatra. But before his departure, he had repeated
the order given prior to his previous visit, that
Mariamne should be put to death in case his cause
should take a fatal turn in Rome. Learning of this
revolting plan in his absence, she upbraided him on his
return. This gave his envious relatives opportunity to
slander her and defame her honor. The jealous Herod
believed the calumny against his innocent wife&mdash;and
think of it&mdash;ordered her to be put to death, though, in
his savage, sensual way, he loved her. Remorse came
too late, which wild excesses could not drown. Soon her
mother followed her to the block on the better founded
charge of conspiracy. More deeds of needless bloodshed
were perpetrated by his wanton command until every
remnant of the Hasmonean house was destroyed.</p>


<h4>Herod as Builder.</h4>

<p>Herod was a renowned builder. He wanted to have
a splendid capital with which he might dazzle Roman
grandees and foreign plenipotentiaries. Notice the
bent of his mind&mdash;his conception of a monarch&mdash;not a
father of his people living up to such a maxim, for example,
as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ich dïen</i> (I serve) but the possessor of glory
and with the power to play with the life and death of his
subjects. He must needs have grandeur without, though
there was misery enough within. He erected temples,
amphitheatres and hippodromes. He built for himself a
palace that was a fortress too, with parks and gardens
around it. New cities were laid out, not for the honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">&nbsp;</a><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">&nbsp;</a><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of Israel but for the honor of Augustus Caesar and
named after him. Samaria was rebuilt and renamed
Sebaste. He rebuilt a city on the coast and called it
Caesarea, with a fine haven. One he named Antipatris
after his father, another after his brother, Phasaelis;
Agrippaeum, after Agrippa, and Herodium, a stronghold,
after himself. Existing fortresses were restored
and strengthened. Nor did he neglect to mark the outlying
provinces with examples of his building passion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus105.jpg" width="300" height="516" alt="Augustus" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Emperor Augustus.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The old Temple, built in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah,
now looked shabby among these fine edifices, and
he determined to rebuild it. This was one of his great
achievements. There was no religious motive whatever
in the project, for he had built outside of Jerusalem
many heathen shrines. The purpose was wholly worldly.
If there is to be a Temple, let it be gorgeous to gratify
my vanity! It took many years to build and was not
finished till long after Herod's death. The whole circumference
of the Temple, including the fortress of
Antonia connected with it, covered almost a mile. It
must have been magnificent, for a proverb arose, "He
who has not seen Herod's Temple has never seen anything
beautiful." Yet, with all his grandeur, he was
but a subject king under the sway of the Roman emperor.
He could not make treaties or war without the
consent of the emperor, to whom he had to supply on
demand troops and money.</p>

<p>The introduction of heathen games in theatres and
race-courses, in which the lives of gladiators and runners
were lightly sacrificed to gratify the brutal instincts of
the spectators, deeply grieved the Jews, imbued with
the sanctity of human life. It was in such violent antagonism
to the ethics of Judaism. But what could they
do? They were in the power of this pagan tyrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>He gathered in his capital, too, Greek litterateurs and
artists. To these scholars were given state positions of
trust. But this was no more an indication of love of
culture than Temple building was love of religion. Ostentation
was at the root of both.</p>

<p>Yet the Pharisaic party (the great mass of the people)
was too strong for him to carry his paganizing influence
as far as he wished. He ungraciously yielded,
out of prudence, now and then to the religious sensibilities
of the people. The building of the sanctuary proper
he entrusted to priests, nor were images placed on the
Jerusalem buildings. But the Roman eagle was later
erected over the Temple gate. For an attempt to remove
it, forty-two young men, zealous for the law, were burnt
alive. The Jewish Sanhedrin was shorn of all power.</p>

<p>He appointed unfit men as High Priests and removed
them when they did not do his bidding. That such appointments
should be left in his unsympathetic hands.
Finally, the people were heavily taxed to support heathen
splendor of which they did not approve. So his reign,
so hateful to them, was maintained only by despotism
and force. An attempt was even made to assassinate
him. The populace had to be watched by spies. Yet in
the year 25 he brought all his energies to the fore to
save the people from the consequences of famine. Let
us remember this in his favor; also that he used his
power to secure protection for Jews in the Diaspora.</p>


<h4>Herod as Father.</h4>

<p>By paying lavish court to the emperor and his son-in-law,
Agrippa, his territory was gradually doubled. A
splendid kingdom viewed superficially, but it brought no
happiness to this unscrupulous man. Peace in the home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
domestic joy, these are the things that prowess and power
cannot buy. The story of how this barbarian had put
to death his favorite wife, Mariamne, has already been
told. Her two sons were now grown to man's estate.
But Herod's sister, the wicked Salome, who had plotted
against their mother, now tried to fill the king's mind
with suspicions against her sons. In this purpose she
was aided by Antipater, son of Herod by another of
his wives. Learning that their mother had been put to
death by their father's mandate, they openly expressed
their anger, which so increased the king's suspicions, that
he accused his sons before the emperor. The mildness
of Augustus could only postpone the eventual tragedy&mdash;the
execution of the young men by order of their own
father. Antipater&mdash;the real conspirator against Herod,
though his favorite son,&mdash;was at last detected, and of
course executed also. Surely the latter days of this king
were bitter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These domestic troubles were aggravated by bodily
disease and the knowledge that he was hated by his
people. Determined to be mourned at all costs, he imprisoned
some of the most distinguished men of the
nation with orders that they were to be killed at the
moment of his death. Thus would he obtain a mourning
at his funeral! Was not this the climax of savagery!
This fiendish purpose was, however, never carried
out; so he died unwept and unmourned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He is called "Great" to distinguish him from some
puny Herods that followed in the fast dying Jewish
State. We can call him "Great" only in a bad sense&mdash;an
awful example of the abuse of power in the hands of an
unscrupulous and blood-thirsty man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>HILLEL</h3>


<p>Let us now take a glance at the religious life of Judah
in this reign. The picture is brighter. Hillel was made
president of the Sanhedrin in the year 30. A new direction
was given to the development of rabbinic Judaism
under his guidance. He was the greatest Jewish
teacher since Ezra. Like Ezra he came from Babylon,
which had remained a Jewish centre since the exile, 600
<small>B. C. E.</small>, and was to continue to be a Jewish centre for
many centuries later. Pleasing stories are told of the
sacrifices made by this poor boy to gratify his thirst for
knowledge. Once he was almost frozen to death while
lying on the skylight to hear the discussion, since he was
not allowed to hear it from within. Ultimately he was
placed at the head of the Sanhedrin where at first he
was a beggar at its doors. Great as he was as an expounder
of the Law, he is perhaps best known by the
sweetness of his character. None could put him out of
temper, it is said. This story is given as illustration. A
man who ventured a wager that he would rouse Hillel's
wrath called thrice at the most inopportune time asking
the absurdest questions, and each time more rudely than
before. The attempt failed. On hearing the explanation
of this strange behavior, Hillel, unruffled to the
last, said, "Better that you should lose your wager than
I my temper." He united in himself gentleness and firmness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>


<h4>Hillel as Moralist.</h4>

<p>Many interesting instances are given of his evenness
of disposition that disarmed the violent and won many
a convert to the fold, where the brusqueness of his colleague&mdash;Shammai&mdash;often
drove them away. "Be patient
like Hillel, not passionate like Shammai," ran the saying.
Thus Hillel became the peacemaker in those troublous
Herodian days. In this connection he taught, "Be of
the disciples of Aaron&mdash;loving and pursuing peace, loving
mankind and bringing them nigh to the Law."
His consideration for others went so far that, a man of
standing, becoming suddenly poor, he provided him with
a horse and servant that he might still enjoy some of
the comforts of his earlier life.</p>

<p>He is the author of the famous Golden Rule in its
earlier form, uttered in reply to a heathen who would
have him teach the whole Law while he stood on one
foot: "That which is hateful to thee do not unto thy
neighbor; this is the principle, all the rest is commentary."
Another heathen must needs be made a priest if
converted: Hillel gently showed him the prohibition of
the Law. But the instances show that proselytism was
encouraged.</p>

<p>In the following maxims many phases of his character
are revealed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He who craves to raise his name, lowers it."</p>

<p>"A name inflated is a name destroyed."</p>

<p>"My humility is my pride, my pride my humility."</p>

<p>"He who will not learn or teach deserves death."</p>

<p>"He who does not progress, retrogrades."</p>

<p>"Say not, 'when I have leisure I will study,' for
you may never have leisure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Study God's word; then both this world and the
next will be thine."</p>

<p>"Trust not thyself till the day of thy death."</p>

<p>"In a place where there is no man, strive to show
thyself a man."</p>

<p>"Judge not thy neighbor till thou art in his place."</p>

<p>"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? But
if I am for myself alone, what am I? And if not
now, when?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you realize how much is contained in that last
maxim? Unravel it and you will see revealed his philosophy
of life.</p>


<h4>Hillel as Legislator.</h4>

<p>So gentle, he was yet daring. When an old law was
abused, he ventured to modify it. The Law, for example,
for release of debts every seventh year, made
particularly for the benefit of the poor (Deut. xv),
hampered the growth of trade in more complex times
and changed a generous purpose into an occasional embarrassment.
There is a gulf of difference between a
loan to buy bread and a loan for business enterprise. In
the latter case Hillel allowed the stipulation to be stated
in the contract, called <em>prosbul</em>, that the law of release was
to be suspended.</p>

<p>To Hillel is due the important service of devising a
logical system of seven rules of deduction by which
new laws to meet new needs could be developed out of
the fewer and more general principles in the Bible code.
It must be confessed that these deductions were occasionally
far-fetched. None the less the custom prevailed
among the rabbis to make laws for all exigencies in that
way for many centuries to come. The practice arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
from the reverence paid the five books of Moses that
induced them to seek authority for every regulation they
found needful, in their pages. We might say it was a
virtue carried to the extreme of a fault. Hillel's method
earned him the title "Regenerator of the Law."</p>


<h4>Last Days.</h4>

<p>"Where goest thou, Master," said Hillel's disciples
one day when he hastened from the house of learning.
"I go to meet a guest," Hillel replied. "Who is this
guest of whom thou so often speakest?" The sweetness
of the master's face deepened into earnestness. "My
guest is my soul. Too often in intercourse with the world
must its claims be pushed aside."</p>

<p>But the day came, as indeed it must, when the soul
was summoned to a greater tribunal than his own. The
day of Hillel's death was a day of mourning in Israel.
"O, pious, gentle, worthy follower of Ezra," cried the
sorrowing people. Contrast his death with Herod's.</p>

<p>Such was the love and esteem in which he was held
by the scholars of his own and later ages, that the presidency
of the Sanhedrin was kept in his family for four
centuries (like a royal succession), and in this way his
memory reverenced for many generations.</p>


<h4>Shammai.</h4>

<p>In Hillel and Shammai, the "Pairs" referred to in
chapter viii reached their culmination. A teaching of
Shammai ran, "Say little but do much." These two men
were the founders of two distinct schools of interpretation
of Jewish Law. They were as distinct in their
character as in their exposition of Scripture. Hillel
was broad, tolerant and original; Shammai&mdash;narrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
strict, and conservative. (Hillel's opinions were usually
accepted by later generations.) Shammai was a pessimist
saying "It were better not to have been born." Hillel
was an optimist, and said, "Being born, make the most
of life."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To the Shammai school we owe the many stringent
prohibitions with regard to the Sabbath and to ecclesiastical
purity. They objected even to teaching the young,
visiting the sick, or comforting mourners on the Sabbath
day. We are glad to state that Jewish practice has taken
the opposite view. The rabbis of the Shammai school
were not only severe in their religious decisions, but also
in the interpretation of patriotism and in their views of
life generally. Their gloomy philosophy is shown in
Second Esdras: see chap. v., on the Apocrypha. We might
compare them with the first Puritan settlers in America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This school, also unlike Hillel's, opposed the admission
of proselytes from the heathen. Yet in those stormy
times, these severe views against the heathen found the
larger following. From these doubtless came the band
of Zealots whose fanatic hatred of Rome and its institutions
became almost a religion, and whose deeds, to be
told later, form a lurid chapter in Judah's closing days.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Notes and References.</span></h4>

<h5><em>Law and Equity</em>:</h5>

<p>According to ancient Jewish law a city home sold
could be redeemed within a year. "But suppose the owner
lock it up and depart." "Break the lock and lodge the
money with the court," said Hillel. He touched a modern
need in showing here that craft must not defeat the benevolent
purpose of the Law.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>HEROD'S SUCCESSORS.</h3>


<p>The selfish Herod had split up his kingdom among his
three sons&mdash;Archelaus, Antipas and Philip. Before Rome
had yet confirmed the succession, and while a procurator
was placed in temporary charge, already the sons were
intriguing against each other. Rome carried out Herod's
wishes, only that his sons were made tetrarchs instead
of kings. How steadily Rome moved toward its purposed
end!</p>

<p>Archelaus was made tetrarch of Judea, Samaria, and
Idumea. The realm of Antipas was Galilee and Perea,
the Jordan dividing the two districts. To Philip was
given the remaining provinces of Batanæa and Trachonitis
in northern Palestine. Look at the map in front of
this book.</p>

<p>A word on each of these principalities in the inverse
order of importance. Philip held a mild sway for thirty-seven
years. There is nothing to record in these outlying
provinces, partly because they were far removed from
the Jewish centre of gravity.</p>


<h4>Antipas and
John the Baptist.</h4>

<p>The realm of Antipas, often mentioned in the New
Testament, was a little nearer. His recognition of Judaism
was only formal. He inherited all his father's vices
and like his father, too, he was a great builder. He
built Sepphoris in Galilee, and Tiberias on the Lake of
Gennesaret. In his reign and realm flourished John the
Baptist of Perea, and also Jesus of Nazareth in Galilee.
As this term, <em>Baptist</em>, was applied to the Essenes, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of their frequent ablutions (see p. 82), John may
have been a leader of that party.</p>

<p>We know that John preached in the wilderness in the
neighborhood of the Jordan, the centre of the Essenes.
His bold words, in which he denounced the king, led to
his imprisonment, on political grounds, as an agitator.
His influence on the people was feared by Rome, for it
was hard then to separate religion and politics. It is
sometimes hard now. It is said he was finally put to
death at the wish of a dancer, Salome, but really to please
her mother, Herodias, a wanton woman, to marry whom
Antipas had divorced his wife, the daughter of an Arabian
king. This not only involved him in a disastrous
war, but Herodias caused him eventually the loss of his
government and his freedom. For, aiming at a kingship
at her instigation, he was banished, and his tetrarchy
given to Agrippa, of whom we shall hear later on.</p>


<h4>The Last Herodian.</h4>

<p>To come now to Judea proper; together with Samaria
and Idumea, it was entrusted to the unfit Archelaus;
like his father he, too, had to secure his throne
through bloodshed. Plots and counterplots with the appearance
of pretenders for the thrones of Judea and
Galilee, characterized this unhappy time. The Jews
were disgusted with the rule of Rome and its creatures,
and some began open rebellion. The Syrian governor
finally quelled the revolt, but thousands were slain. Had
the Jewish malcontents been organized under trustworthy
leadership, something might have been achieved. As
it was, it ended in their more complete subjection.</p>

<p>There is little else to tell of the reign of Archelaus.
Serious charges were brought against this tyrant; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
serious that the emperor recalled him to Rome and deposed
him. He had reigned ten years, 4 <small>B.C.E.</small> to 6 <small>A. C. E.</small>,
thus crossing the dividing line of what is called the
Christian Era, from the tradition that it marked the
birth of Jesus of Nazareth; he was actually born four
years earlier than this date.</p>

<p>Herod had brought Judea so completely under Roman
control, that bit by bit all the old vested rights, privileges
and local powers had been taken from its Sanhedrin,
its High Priest and its royal family. Herod had
practically sold Judea to Rome for the privilege of subserving
as its king. Its fate was now wholly in Rome's
hands.</p>


<h4>Judea Part of
a Roman Province.</h4>

<p>Leaving the outlying provinces under the rule of tetrarchs,
Rome now decided to govern Judea absolutely
as a part of the province of Syria. It sent out governors
or, as they were called, <em>Procurators</em>, to administer its
affairs under the more immediate direction of Syria. The
Jews were now to be ruled by strangers who had no understanding
of their religion and no sympathy with their
traditions or social needs; by men possessed in fact,
for the most part, of an ill-concealed antagonism to the
rites and obligations that entered into the lives of conscientious
Jews.</p>

<p>At its best Judea had been a Theocracy, i.e., a kingdom
in which religion, represented by the priesthood and
the Sanhedrin, directed the affairs of the nation. Roman
rule, therefore, would be revolutionary, even had the
procurators been good men and had sought to administer
the province in kindness and equity. As a matter of
fact, they were nearly all tyrants, lustful for gain at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
price and absolutely indifferent to the welfare of the
people under their charge; even as we shall see, in many
instances wantonly wounding Judea's sensibilities to gratify
their cruel pleasure. No wonder the Jews were
eventually goaded into a war of desperation.</p>

<p>As to the Jews in other lands under Roman sway, we
find Augustus Caesar well disposed to them. He placed
the harbors of the Nile under Judean Alabarchs (same
as Arabarch). His kindness to the Alexandrian Jews
was in marked contrast with his severity toward the
Alexandrian Greeks. In the city of Rome he allowed
the Jewish settlers&mdash;Libertini&mdash;to observe their religion
undisturbed, and to build synagogues.</p>

<p>So in the deepening shadows there was a glimmer of
light too.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>PILATE THE PROCURATOR.</h3>


<h4>Procurators
in general.</h4>

<p>The Procurators fall into two groups, with a Jewish
king intervening. The table above is the first group of
these administrators of Judea. Their seat of government
was Caesarea, a city that had become Jerusalem's
rival. The Jews had a certain freedom under this regime.
"The oath of allegiance to the Roman emperor
was more an oath of confederates than of subjects."
The Sanhedrin was still supposed to be the governing
body for home affairs with the High Priest as its president.
But the arbitrary appointment and removal of
High Priests by the procurator, placed these powers at
the mercy of his caprice, and ultimately the Jews were
robbed of these prerogatives altogether. The procurator
then could always interfere with the carrying out of Jewish
law. It is important that these facts should be borne
in mind in the events of the next chapter. Even in religious
offenses where the High Priest with the Sanhedrin
could pronounce the death sentence, the confirmation of
the procurator was required for the execution. So heavily
were the people taxed that the tax-gatherers (called <em>publicans</em>)
were looked upon with opprobrium. Doubtless
many of them dishonestly abused their power.</p>

<p>Still Judea was the only province in which the worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the emperor was not compulsory. The reason is
obvious. To pagan communities it was a command which
they could obey complacently; to the monotheistic Jews
recognizing one sole spirit God, it was simply impossible.
It was attempted by the Emperor Caligula, but failed.
Even the local coinage bore no figure, nor were the
standards bearing the likenesses of the emperor tolerated,
as such was regarded as an offense by the strict interpreters
of the second commandment. One tyrant
tried and failed to force these banners on Judea. They
violently opposed a census in the year 7 both on religious
and on political grounds, as they regarded it as an infringement
of their sacred rights and the precursor of
slavery. But Joezer, the High Priest, quieted them and
induced them to submit.</p>

<p>Still, from such incidents the stern determination of
the Jews may be inferred. Judas of Gamala, a Galilean,
and a religious enthusiast, went about preaching the duty
of rebellion and the sin of submission. Gradually these
malcontents formed themselves into a new party of extremists&mdash;the
<em>Zealots</em>, who believed in using the sword
against the heathen to hasten the Messianic realization.
They already began nursing the smouldering embers of
rebellion.</p>


<h4>Pilate in Particular.</h4>

<p>Such was the status under the procurators in general.
We will treat in detail the regime of only one&mdash;Pontius
Pilate. It is characteristic of all, but especially eventful
in many ways.</p>

<p>The Jewish historian, Josephus, and the Jewish philosopher,
Philo, have much to tell of his doings. From the
trustworthy Philo we are told that he was of "an unbending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and recklessly hard character." "He has been
charged with corruptibility, violence, robberies, ill-treatment
of the people, continued executions without even
the form of trial, endless and intolerable cruelties."</p>

<p>On his first entry into Jerusalem he determined to outrage
the religious sensibilities of the people he was sent
to protect, by bidding his Roman soldiers hoist a flag
with the Emperor's likeness. They petitioned for its removal.
He refused. For five days they stood outside
the palace urging their request. When the soldiers with
drawn swords stood ready to slay at his signal, the people
bared their necks, preferring death to toleration of
this idolatrous emblem. Such was the intensity of the
Jews of these last years of their national life, such was the
stuff of which they were made. Even tyrants reach limits
beyond which they dare not pass. The emblem was
sullenly withdrawn.</p>

<p>At another time he appropriated the Temple treasures,
sacredly set aside for religious purposes, for the building
of an aqueduct to Jerusalem. This time he resorted
to violence to quell the opposition, many lives being sacrificed.</p>

<p>With the purpose only of annoying the people, he put
up votive shields inscribed with the emperor's name.
But they appealed to Tiberius who not only ordered them
removed, but rebuked Pilate for raising them.</p>

<p>On another occasion the Samaritans, to whom Gerizim
had all the sanctity that Sinai had for Israel, because the
Mosaic Blessings were announced from its heights (see
Deut, xi, 29, Joshua, viii, 33), gathered there on a rumor
that sacred vessels were hidden in its soil. Pilate sent
soldiers wantonly to slaughter them. This led to his recall
by Tiberius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>


<h4>Proselytes.</h4>

<p>The Emperor Tiberius decided that it was kinder to
the Jews to appoint procurators for long terms than to
make frequent changes. It meant the greed of a smaller
number to be satisfied. But, on the whole, his attitude
was less friendly than that of his predecessor, Augustus.
This may have been due to the fact that many Romans
of high birth had, unsolicited, accepted the Jewish faith,
and had sent gifts to the Temple at Jerusalem. Among
these converts was Fulvia, wife of a Roman senator. This
led to the banishment from Rome of many thousands of
Jews to a dangerous climate. Here was the beginning
of a religious persecution.</p>

<p>The incident, however, shows that the worthier Romans
were becoming more and more distrustful of pagan
cults and were looking for something better. We shall
see later how zealous Jews from Judea, and more particularly
from Alexandria, began making converts to
Judaism all through Asia Minor. The influence of these
converts on future events was farther reaching than their
sponsors ever dreamed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>JESUS OF NAZARETH.</h3>


<p>So far the rule of Pontius Pilate as it concerned Judea.
But his rule has become of wide import because of
his relation to Jesus of Nazareth, who was put to death
during his administration, though born in the province
of Galilee governed by Herod Antipas. To explain how
a great religion sprang up around this Galilean Jew,
which came afterwards to regard him as its father, can
be explained only by a complete grasp of the political
and religious aspirations of the time.</p>


<h4>The Messianic Hope.</h4>

<p>The ominous mood in which the Jews realized their
gradual deprivation of country and independence indicated
the stirring of deep forces in their nature. Judea
was to them a Holy Land, for "from Zion had gone
forth the Law." Love of country had become part of
their religion. Every political function had its religious
aspect. The Sanhedrin was at once a civil and a religious
body, and this dual characteristic pervaded all the civil
institutions. So the longing for the restoration of the
royal line of Judah, i.e., the coming of the Messiah, expressed
the religious as well as the political hopes of
the nation. Not that the word Messiah had any peculiarly
religious significance. It is the Hebrew word <i>M'sheach</i>,
meaning "Anointed (king)," and was applied in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the Bible to Saul, David, and even to Cyrus, the Persian,
Isaiah xlv&mdash;1. In post-exilic times the coming of the
Messiah implied the re-establishment of the throne in
the Davidic line.</p>

<p>Many of the pious felt further that with a king once
more on an independent throne, the glorious pictures of
the coming day foretold by the Prophets and not attained
in the first monarchy, would be realized in the second.
Such as "The Lord's house will be established on the top
of the mountains; all nations will flock to it, saying, Come
let us go up to the house of the Lord, to the house of the
God of Jacob. He will teach us His ways, we will walk
in His paths." (Isaiah and Micah.) Again, "The earth
will be full of knowledge of God as the waters cover
the sea." The conviction expressed by Jeremiah (chap.
xxxi, 33-34) would then be fulfilled, that all would
"know the Lord from the least of them to the greatest."
One of the latest of the Prophets&mdash;Zechariah&mdash;had foretold
a day when "ten men would take hold of the garments
of him who was a Jew and would say, We will go
with you, for we believe that God is with you." So we
might quote nearly every prophet from Amos to Malachi,
the last prophet, who said that the day of Judgment would
be heralded by the undying Elijah. A Jewish poet in
Alexandria voiced the same hope; heathendom would disappear
and the kingdom of God would be established.</p>

<p>Alas, the outlook for either the spiritual or the temporal
realization seemed farther removed than ever. Every
now and then, more particularly under the disturbing rule
of the procurators, a deluded enthusiast would appear
upon the scene and claim that he was a Messiah. Theudas
was one who made this claim in the year 45. So desperate
were the times that these agitators always found
followers. They were always ruthlessly put to death by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Rome for the claim of Messiahship, i.e., "King of the
Jews," was treason against Rome. Was not Judea a
Roman province now?</p>


<h4>Jesus the Man.</h4>

<p>In chapter vii the Essenes have been mentioned. This
sect, that lived as a brotherhood in the vicinity of the
Dead Sea, shared all goods in common, condemned
wealth and passed simple lives away from the great world.
They, too, looked for the coming of the Messiah. But it
was the religious climax of the prophets just quoted
that would follow the Messiah's advent&mdash;the ushering in
triumph of an independent nationality, that most appealed
to them. This lofty view was also shared by the more
saintly among the Israelites in general; nor was it ever
entirely absent even from the popular view.</p>

<p>We have already heard of John the Baptist (Essene),
who so stirred the people by preaching that "the kingdom
of God" was at hand; this was the Messianic hope. He
evidently inspired one youth, who was in close sympathy
with the Essene brotherhood, Joshua (Greek Jesus) from
Nazareth, in Galilee. Galilee, like the other provinces in
northern Palestine, was away from the learning and culture
of Jerusalem. It was the home of simple folk who
spoke a corrupt dialect, and who credulously accepted
popular superstitions; such as, every disease comes from
an indwelling spirit or demon.</p>

<p>Of the life of the man Jesus who came from these surroundings
<em>little is really known</em>, but from a few bare facts
very much has been deduced and still more imagined.
Apart from the fact that he was the son of a carpenter,
Joseph, we only hear of him about two years before his
death, and that occurred at the early age of thirty-two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
We find him preaching and expounding the Law and
sympathizing with the unfortunate classes.</p>

<p>Though by no means a profound scholar in the Law,
he exhibited fine moral perception and lived up to the
pure ideals of the strict, peace-loving Essene brotherhood.
In his teachings or rather preachings, he followed
the models of the great prophets, laying stress upon the
spirit of religion and minimizing the value of ceremonial.
For there were formalists in those days as there were in
the days before the Exile. Indeed, every age reveals the
experience that the multitude is often more impressed by
the ceremony than the idea it is intended to convey&mdash;and
gives more attention to the outward, tangible form than
to its inward, spiritual purpose, the exaltation of life.
Nor is that tendency confined to the ignorant either. Religion
so easily sinks into a mechanical routine unless we
keep vigilant watch. This lesson is preached by the moralists
of every age. It was preached by Jesus of Nazareth
with rare power. He had soon a large following,
perhaps, too, for the reason that he was now regarded as
John the Baptist's successor.</p>


<h4>Jesus the Messiah.</h4>

<p>But it was not so much his ethical teaching, lofty
though it was, that brought him into prominence and
caused the crowds to gather about him, though a modern
school of Christian apologetics lays stress upon that
now. It was partly because he was regarded as a "healer,"
a power claimed by the Essenes; but chiefly because
he was regarded as the long-looked for <em>Messiah</em> who
would deliver Israel from the thraldom of Rome and
gratify their wildest expectations. Whether he first
of his own accord laid claim to this mysterious title, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
whether he was persuaded into it by his admirers, we
cannot gather from the few records that tell the events
of his life. For even the earliest of these records, the
so-called Gospel of Mark, was not written till nearly fifty
years after his death, at a time when startling opinions
had already been formed about him; and they do not
agree even as to his parentage and birthplace. In fact,
once regarded as the Messiah, his biography was <em>recast</em> to
fit the Messianic prophecies in the Scriptures! This made
the Jesus of the Gospels largely a mythical character.</p>

<p>Jesus could quite honestly have believed himself to be a
Messiah in some religious sense, though he was rather
evasive when bluntly questioned. For many sincere enthusiasts
both before and since his time have believed
themselves specially chosen messengers of God to bring
redemption to their people. It will be seen at the end of
this volume that Mohammed, who flourished several centuries
later, believed himself to be sent by God to bring
salvation to the Arabians. In a sense he was; to call
him an impostor, an earlier practise of the Church, is uncharitable
and untrue. In Israel's history, since the days
of the procurators not a century has passed but some one
has come forward claiming to be the Messiah. Some
were honest, though mistaken; some were mere adventurers.</p>

<p>Jesus probably accepted the Essene idea of the Messiah,
that is, he was less concerned with ushering in an
earthly than a heavenly kingdom.</p>

<p>This distinction was not clearly realized by the simple
masses of the people, groaning under a hated yoke;
certainly it was not realized by the Romans, who saw in
every Messianic claim treason against Rome, a plot to
win independence for Judea again. On the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Jesus applying to himself on one occasion the term "son
of God"&mdash;that may mean so little or so much&mdash;awakened
the alarm and antagonism of the priesthood and lost for
him many supporters. So Jesus, who was probably innocent
of any blasphemous assumptions against Judaism and
guiltless of any conspiracy against Rome to seize the
throne and be made "King of the Jews," was nevertheless
condemned to death like the Messiahs before him
and was executed by the Roman method of capital punishment,
crucifixion. But unlike the Messiahs before
him&mdash;all mediocre men&mdash;his name has been treasured
ever since as one of the great religious teachers of the
world.</p>


<h4>Christianity.</h4>

<p>For although he died without bringing the redemption
which would have proven his Messiahship, his followers
did not lose faith in him. His turning kindly to the poor
and despised folk, even to the sinful and degraded with
his message of comfort, had won all hearts. As they believed
he had performed miracles in his life-time, so now
they tried to persuade themselves that a greater miracle
had been fulfilled in his death&mdash;that he had not really
died, but had been translated to heaven like Elijah or
Enoch and that he would return some day and complete
his unfinished work. In those unlettered days belief in
the supernatural was very common. Among certain
folk it is not so uncommon to-day.</p>

<p>So these believers that Jesus was the Messiah became
a new sect called <em>Christians</em>. What does "Christian"
mean? Christ (Christos) is the Greek for Messiah. So
the name Christians meant Messians, and the name Jesus
Christ means Jesus the Messiah. Though Jesus himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
did not speak Greek, but Aramaic, the Christian
Scriptures were written in Greek.</p>

<p>The Jewish Christians continued to live much as the
Essenes before them, like them assuming voluntary poverty
and faithful as of old to the Jewish Law. But in
later years when many pagans joined this sect, they introduced
into it many idolatrous notions, borrowed from
the cults of Greece, Rome and Egypt. The man Jesus
was exalted into a divinity and worshipped as such. The
shedding of his blood at his execution was regarded as
a sacrifice intended by God to atone for the sins of mankind,
based on the ancient idea that the priest shed the
blood of an animal in atoning for the sins of the people;
but the Hebrew prophets and some of the psalmists had
all condemned animal sacrifice as a means of atonement.
This belief was a stage of religion beyond which the
Jews were advancing. It died out altogether before the
century was over&mdash;just when it was being revived in
this way by Christians.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next step which separated the Jews from the
Christians was the depreciation and ultimately the abrogation
of the Jewish Law. This was brought about by
a later teacher, Paul, at first opposed to Christians, but
later their most eloquent advocate. This abandonment
of the Law, ultimately conceded by the early Messians,
who had so far still clung to it, severed their relationship
with the parent faith. Thus Paul made Christianity a
new religion for the heathen world.</p>

<p>The process by which this Jewish sect became a new
religion, most of whose adherents came from the heathen
world, was slow and gradual. We shall refer to the
different steps in the development of this Faith as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
occur, and we shall see how this sect, born in Judaism,
became its antagonist and persecutor in later days.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Notes and References.</span></h4>


<h5><em>Biography of Jesus</em>:</h5>

<p>In recasting his life from the meagre data at hand
his biographers ascribed to him all of the miracles told
of Elijah and Elisha&mdash;feeding the multitude with a few
loaves, curing the sick, reviving the dead and being
transported to heaven.</p>


<h5><em>Teachings of Jesus</em>:</h5>

<p>He taught nothing heretical or startlingly new; he
preferred to emphasize the old. The phrases of "the
Lord's Prayer" are biblical; the Beatitudes (a group of
Blessings in the New Testament) are rabbinic; his communistic
views, those of the Essene school.</p>

<p>The chief source of his teachings was the <em>Didache</em>, i.e.,
a summary of the Faith used by the Synagogue for
proselytes. It contained the <em>Shema</em> followed by "Thou
shalt love the Lord God, etc.;" love thy neighbor as
thyself&mdash;Hillel's Golden Rule; the Ten Commandments;
a disquisition on "the two ways"&mdash;right and wrong.</p>

<p>He followed the rabbis in teaching largely by <em>Mashal</em>&mdash;parable.
Even the form "Ye have heard, etc., but I
will go further yet, etc.," is rabbinic.</p>


<h5><em>The Crucifixion</em>:</h5>

<p>The reasons why the death of Jesus should not be
attributed to the Jews, may be summarized as follows.
(See <cite>Jewish Encyclopedia</cite>, vol. iv.)</p>

<p>Crucifixion was not a Jewish, but a Roman method
of capital punishment. Prior to the open rebellion against
Rome, 30-66 <small>C. E.</small>, many Jews were crucified as rebels,
and on very meagre evidence. A Messiah in its eyes
was a rebel; the inscription placed on the cross was
"King of the Jews."</p>

<p>"The mode and manner of Jesus' death undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
point to Roman custom and law as the directive
power," though Jews may have administered a soothing
cup to lessen the suffering.</p>

<p>None of the well established measures of precaution
were taken that always preceded a Jewish execution. It
is very doubtful whether Jewish law would tolerate a
three-fold execution at one time.</p>

<p>A Jewish execution on Friday is almost impossible.
If Jesus died on Nissan 14, the execution on the eve of a
festival would be irregular. If on Nissan 15 (Passover),
the execution could not be held. There is no
corroboration of the custom to liberate a condemned
person on account of a holiday.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>THE ALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL.</h3>


<h4>Jew and Greek.</h4>

<p>Before resuming the story of Judea under the procurators,
let us take another survey of Jews and Judaism
in lands outside of Palestine. The voluntary dispersion
still went on. The Jews were now scattered over all
the Roman Empire, which included Asiatic and European
lands from Syria to Spain. We also find our ancestors,
at the beginning of the Christian era, in Arabia and in
Parthia, an Asiatic kingdom south of the Caspian Sea.
But, however widely scattered, religion was the bond
of union and Jerusalem the spiritual centre. From distant
lands many would from time to time make pilgrimages
to the Temple.</p>

<p>The attitude of the heathen world was on the whole
not unfriendly to the Jews. They were disliked for their
rejection of the heathen gods, for their aloofness, their
stern morality, their sobriety, and their material success;
while their exclusiveness&mdash;partly but not wholly justifiable&mdash;led
to the erroneous supposition that they were hostile
to mankind. But the Jews of the Diaspora were less
exclusive and more tolerant than those of Judea. This
was particularly true of Alexandria, capital of Egypt,
now part of the Roman Empire. There had existed
here&mdash;apart from occasional outbursts of racial antagonism
among the populace, a cordial interchange of ideas
in which the Jews met the Greeks more than half
way. (chaps. ii and vi.)</p>

<p>The Jews admired the culture of the educated Greeks
and felt drawn toward the lofty philosophy of Plato, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
nearest Greek approach to the monotheism and morality
of the Hebrews. The broadening effect of this infusion
of Greek thought, gave to Judaism in Alexandria
a distinct character, and it came to be known as Hellenistic
Judaism, and its espousers, Hellenistic Jews. We
have used the term Hellenist in an earlier chapter, in a
bad sense as descriptive of Jews who yielded to those
Greek influences that were pagan, to the detriment of
Judaism. Here we apply the term in a good sense to
those who were open to Greek influences that were
intellectual, to the advantage of Judaism. We have
already marked the effect of Greek thought in some of
the Apocryphal writings, particularly in the "Wisdom
of Solomon." Appreciating the metaphysics of the
Greek philosophers, the Jewish Hellenists were anxious
to bring home to the Greeks and to others the spiritual
and moral truths of Judaism.</p>


<h4>Jewish Missionaries.</h4>

<p>But how to present the revelation of the Law and of
the Prophets in a manner that would most appeal to
the Greeks? In their fervor to make proselytes to the
Law of Moses, they resorted to a strange expedient.
There existed among the Greeks women-seers called
Sibyls, who were supposed to foretell in mysterious
oracles the destinies of nations. So some Jewish writers
cast the Bible teachings of God and morality in the
literary form of Sibylline oracles. Like the Bible
prophets, these Jewish Sibylline writers, warned those
who followed false views and bad lives, and promised
salvation to those who accepted the law of the God of
Israel. They popularized the teachings of the Mosaic law
and so generalized it as to present it as a religion for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
mankind. These writings exerted a salutary influence
on many followers of Greek thought.</p>

<p>The Hellenists went so far as to try to prove from
Jewish Scriptures many of the loftier ideas of Greek
philosophy. In this way Judaism was represented as
anticipating the highest knowledge of the time. In
their enthusiasm, this reconciliation of Judaism and Greek
philosophy was occasionally carried further than conditions
quite warranted. The attempt was also made
to explain every biblical law allegorically, as though
it was intended to convey ideas other than those that
appeared on the surface. Thus they read Greek philosophy
into the Bible. The habit of reading the science
of the day into the old Bible books still prevails. This
poetic explaining away of many injunctions of Scripture
led in some instances to their actual neglect. This was
the dangerous extreme.</p>

<p>The assumption that Jews discourage proselytes has
been refuted in chaps. xii and xiv. It is certainly not
true of the Alexandrian Jews who were most zealous
in their missionary efforts. They not only felt that it
was the mission of the Jew to carry his message to the
world; they did it. The translation of their Scriptures
into Greek, the presentation of the message of their
faith in the form of Sibylline oracles, and the allegorizing
away of many of their ceremonials were all employed
for the bringing of Judaism to the Gentile. So successful
were their efforts, that just when the Jewish state
was dying, many heathens were seeking this Faith of
their own accord, attracted by its ethics and repelled by
heathen uncleanliness. Philo says that the adoption
of Judaism by many heathens immediately resulted in a
marked moral improvement in their lives. The number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of female proselytes in Damascus, Asia Minor, Egypt
and Rome steadily grew. Pagan writers remark it.
Josephus writes:&mdash;"There is not any city of the Greeks
or of the barbarians ... to which our custom of resting
on the seventh day has not been introduced and where
our fasts and dietary laws are not observed." He adds
further how enthusiastically these converts fulfilled all
Jewish rites. A zealous Jewish missionary converted
Helen, the queen of Adiabene, a province on the Tigris,
and all her family. She made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem,
sent valuable gifts to the Temple, and helped the
people in the time of famine.</p>

<p>So, although Judaism was a religion that imposed on
its followers severe restraints and, although the Jews
were a very small people, whom some heathens despised,
still, many knocked at its doors to be admitted into
the fold, even for fifty years after its Temple was destroyed
and its nationality overthrown&mdash;tragedies which
we shall presently have to tell. Yes, many of the very
people that overthrew it&mdash;the Romans&mdash;accepted the
Jewish faith. The Emperor Domitian made severe laws
against proselytes to Judaism, in order to discourage
the practice. Indeed, a cousin of the emperor, who was
also a senator and consul, together with his wife, accepted
Judaism.</p>

<p>But ultimately the stream of converts was diverted
to the new creed, born of Judaism, Christianity&mdash;more
particularly as in its second stage it sent its missionaries
to the heathen world proclaiming that acceptance
of Jesus as savior and divinity would bring them salvation
without conforming to the burdensome Jewish Law.
Furthermore it became a doctrine of the new religion
that the death of Jesus abrogated the Law. Thus, salvation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
made easy, brought thousands to the fold. The
Jewish missionaries had really simplified the task for
the Christian missionaries who followed later. They
prepared the soil.</p>

<p>This is looking a little further ahead to events yet
to be related. By that time the followers of the two
religions had become people of two different races:
Judaism followed almost exclusively by Jews who were
Semites; Christianity by Aryans, Greeks, Romans and
other Europeans. This racial distinction became the
final barrier which completely separated them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Note.</span></h4>

<h5><em>Aryans and Semites</em>:</h5>

<p>Not all Semites are Jews, for example the Arabians;
nor are all Aryans Christians p. e. the Persians. Religious
and racial lines are no longer identical.</p>


<h5><em>Theme for discussion</em>:</h5>

<p>Why did most heathen converts to Judaism ultimately
become Christian?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>PHILO-JUDEUS.</h3>


<p>We are now ready to consider one to whom frequent
reference has been made&mdash;the greatest of the
Alexandrian Jewish missionary philosophers, styled the
"noblest Judean of his age"&mdash;Philo-Judeus. He was
born in Alexandria of good family, about 15 <small>C. E.</small>, just
when Herod was ruling and Hillel was teaching in
Jerusalem. His brother, Alexander, was given the influential
post of farmer of taxes. Both received the best
education the times afforded in literature, music, mathematics
and natural science. Philo early showed a taste
for literature in general, and philosophy in particular.
His circumstances enabled him to devote himself to a
literary life, for which he was peculiarly gifted. He
showed his warm interest in the cause of his people in
his journey to Rome as one of the ambassadors to plead
before the mad Emperor Caligula (to be told in the
next chapter). Of this whole incident he himself gives
a graphic account in his chronicles of the Jewish events
of his time.</p>


<h4>His Bible Commentary.</h4>

<p>A many-sided genius, he was the best exponent of
that Hellenistic school that sought to harmonize the
revealed religion of the Torah with the conclusions of
Greek philosophy. He was thoroughly versed in both.
His works, as those of all this school, were written in
Greek. While the form may be that of Plato, the spirit
is that of the prophets. In his commentary on Scripture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
following the allegorical method already referred to,
he treats all the incidents in Genesis, for example, as symbolic
of human development and moral truths underlying
the historic facts on the surface. He did not,
however, go to the extreme of neglecting Jewish observance
on the strength of metaphoric interpretation. Indeed,
he even rebuked those who did. He writes "just
as we must be careful of the body as the house of the
soul, so must we give heed to the letter of the written
laws. For only when these are faithfully observed, will
the inner meaning of which they are the symbols become
more clearly realized."</p>

<p>But he warningly adds "If a man practice ablutions and
purifications, but defiles his mind while he cleanses his
body ... let him none the more be called religious."</p>

<p>In his interpretation of the Mosaic Law in the Pentateuch,
he has the education of the heathen chiefly in
mind. He reveals the harmony of its precepts with
the laws of nature. He groups all duties under the Ten
Commandments. He points out with enthusiasm the
humanity of the Law, and completely refutes slanders
against Judaism by citing examples of its purity, breadth
and philanthropy, such as the Sabbatic year and the
jubilee to eliminate poverty, the freeing of slaves, the
boon of the Sabbath for the servant, the social equality in
the festival rules, the restraints of the dietary laws, the
tenderness and consideration for all human needs in the
code of Deuteronomy. His contrasts are the severest
condemnation of Greek and Roman morals.</p>


<h4>His Philosophy.</h4>

<p>In his philosophy he again applies the allegorical
method to the Pentateuch. In this field of <em>Midrash</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
(homiletic exposition) he may have influenced the later
rabbis of the Talmud, even though rejected by them.
He attempts to show that the lofty ideas found in the
Platonic, Stoic and Neo-pythagorean philosophies were
already taught in the Jewish Scripture. From Moses,
the greatest teacher of mankind, the Greek philosophers
derived their wisdom. From Mosaic Law comes the
highest and truest religious revelation. Thus he endeavored
to win Jews to an appreciation of Greek
literature, and Greeks to an appreciation of Jewish
Scripture.</p>

<p>Philo is the first Jew to present a complete system
of philosophy, yet he weaves it out of the Bible. Just a
word about it. It is hard to treat the philosophy of
any one writer separately, for it is usually linked with
a whole chain of theories of earlier schools. A deep
believer in the spiritual God of his fathers, it was one
of the aims of his life to attain fuller knowledge of
Him. While in his treatment of the divine idea he shows
the influence of the Greek philosopher Plato, yet as
Jew he brings to the philosophic abstraction the religious
warmth of a believer in the living God.</p>

<p>God alone is perfect, unchangeable, devoid of all
qualities and indefinable. Absolutely perfect, He cannot
come in contact with matter, which is defiling. How
does Philo bridge the gap from the spiritual God to
the material world? God acts on the world indirectly
through intermediary causes or powers, which He first
created.</p>


<h4>The Logos.</h4>

<p>These intervening powers he at times calls angels
and at times ideas. He uses a Greek word <em>logos</em> meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Reason. Whence comes this <em>logos</em> which we are
to think of partly as a spirit and again as a thought?
It is a product; or as he expresses it in a Greek idiom,
a <em>child</em> of divine intelligence. By means of this <em>logos</em>,
the perfect spiritual divinity creates the world.</p>

<p>This sounds unfamiliar, but the eighth chapter of
Proverbs and some of the books of the Apocrypha speak
of Wisdom as though it were a kind of being and that
with it God laid the world's foundation. Of course, this
is only figurative. But later the fathers of the Church
put a new and startling construction upon Philo's Logos
and read into it a literalness he never intended. They
changed the <em>logos</em> into an actual human being. Unlike
Philo they did not call it a child of divine intelligence in
the Greek idiomatic sense, but a "son of God" in an actual
and physical sense. It was then but a step for the
Church to declare that Jesus, its Messiah, was the <em>Logos</em>!
He was therefore a species of divinity too. It was not
till Christianity's second stage that Jesus of Nazareth
was in this way raised from a real man into an imaginary
divinity. Thus the link with Judaism was broken in
the rejection of its fundamental principle of monotheism&mdash;the
belief in one indivisible God.</p>

<p>Philo is, of course, only unconsciously the cause of
this doctrinal change, for he did not come in contact
with the new sect of Christians and never mentions it,
and this idea developed after his day. In fact, the divinity
of Jesus had already been adopted, and Philo's writings
were later construed to fit it.</p>


<h4>His Ethics.</h4>

<p>A word on his ethics. Evil is a necessary consequence
of our free will. Without it there could not be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
contrast of good. Evil is associated with the body which
he depicts as the opponent of the soul. The soul emanates
from God like the <em>logos</em>, but attracted by sensuous
matter it descends into mortal bodies. This earthly body
then is the cause of evil. But Philo was too wise to
infer from that the duty of asceticism. He did not teach
that man must suppress his desires and passions and
earthly longings, but that he should suppress them. For
this, man needs the help of God. The wise and virtuous
are uplifted out of themselves to a closer knowledge of
God, and God's spirit dwells in them. This is highest
happiness. While we cannot quite accept his theories,
his conclusions ring true with all the inspiring elements
of lofty religion.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Notes and References.</span></h4>


<h5><em>The Logos</em>:</h5>

<p>The Greek <em>logos</em> also means Word. Just as Proverbs
personifies wisdom, so the Targum (Aramaic translation
of the Bible) identifies the "word of God" with the divine
presence. Here again the Christian mystic goes a
step further and changes a metaphor into a fact. "The
Word of God became flesh; Jesus is that Word!" (Gospel
of St John.)</p>

<p>In his popular but exhaustive work on <cite>Philo-Judaeus</cite>,
(J. P. S. A. 1910) Norman Bentwich writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is idle to try and formulate a single definite
notion of Philo's Logos. For it is the expression
of God in His multiple and manifold activity, the instrument
of creation, the seat of ideas, the world of
thought, which God first established as the model of
the visible universe, the guiding providence, the sower
of virtue, the fount of wisdom, described sometimes
in religious ecstacy, sometimes in philosophical
metaphysics sometimes in the spirit of the mystical
poet."</p></blockquote>

<h5><em>Philo</em>:</h5>

<p>Philo represents an important type, then new&mdash;a Jew
loyal to his faith when living in a non-Jewish atmosphere.
Not all so nobly withstood these surrounding
allurements. His own brother drifted from the fold.
Philo wrote for indifferent Jews as well as for pagan
Greeks.</p>

<p>According to Montefiore, the Greek, according to
Bentwich, the Hebrew note in Philo, is the more pronounced.</p>


<h5><em>Greek Law and Jewish</em>:</h5>

<p>Philo brings out the following contrast. The Greeks
were bidden not to refuse fire and water to those who
needed it, but Judaism bids its followers to give to the
poor and weak all that life requires.</p>

Philonis," by Montefiore, <cite>Jewish Quarterly Review</cite>, Vol.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>A JEWISH KING ONCE MORE.</h3>


<p>In taking up again the thread of Judea's story, let
its relation to the Roman State be clearly understood. It
was under the immediate supervision of the procurator.
He in turn was subject to the higher power of the governor
of Syria. Both were answerable to the supreme
authority&mdash;the emperor at Rome. Though the Syrian
governors came little in contract with Judea, at times their
intervention was important. We may instance Vitellius,
who deserves passing mention in Jewish history. In
contrast with the behavior of Pilate the procurator,
was his consideration shown for Jewish sensibilities by
this Syrian governor. "He was the noblest Roman of
them all." He exhibited an uncommon forbearance by
remitting some burdensome taxes; he sympathetically inquired
into the needs of the people and removed from
the High Priesthood the unworthy Caiaphas in whose
time Jesus of Nazareth was executed. He also ordered
Pilate to Rome to answer for his misgovernment.</p>


<h4>The Mad Emperor
Caligula.</h4>

<p>As to the emperors: Some of these gave no thought to
the Jews apart from appointing their procurators. With
others the Jews came in clashing contact. Such was the
case with Caligula who donned the purple in 37. This demented
man believed himself to be a divinity, so that obeisance
to his image was not merely an act of allegiance, but
of worship. The consequences of this sacrilegious command
to worship him was the first felt by the Jews of Alexandria;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
for the Ptolemaic and the Seleucid empires were
both Roman now. An actual persecution here took place
in which the Jews were besieged in their own quarter, the
Delta. Their refusal to obey the emperor's childish demand
gave excuse to their tormentors to attack them under
the guise of patriotism. Patriotism may be the mantle
for so many sins. Synagogues were defiled and many
persons were slain. Philo, now advanced in years, led
a deputation to Rome, to intercede for his brethren. He
made an eloquent plea, assuring the emperor of Jewish
loyalty. "They sacrifice for you daily an offering in the
Temple." "<em>For</em> me," sneered Caligula, "not <em>to</em> me."
The deputation suffered many indignities and returned
dispirited.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 324px;">
<img src="images/illus148.jpg" width="324" height="150" alt="Agrippa" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Coin of Agrippa</span> I. 37-44 <small>C. E.</small></p></div>
</div>

<p>To Judea likewise came the same blasphemous demand
with the threat of similar punishment. At last
the mad monarch ordered his image to be set up in the
Temple and entrusted the task to the Syrian governor,
Petronius, a man of the stamp of Vitellius. He did his
best to delay the wanton edict at the risk of the emperor's
displeasure. At last yielding to the agonized entreaty
of the people he imperilled his life by asking the
emperor to revoke the order. Agrippa, a Jewish favorite
of Caligula, succeeded in persuading the emperor to
renounce the abortive project. Soon, however, he repented
and determined on its execution. But relief came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Alexandria and Judea at one stroke&mdash;the emperor was
murdered in 41.</p>

<p>The next emperor, Claudius, restored to the Alexandrian
Jews all the privileges that had been taken from them
during the rule of his predecessor, and their rights were
more firmly established than before. Religious freedom
was now granted to the Jews throughout the whole
Roman empire. But best of all, he stopped the regime of
the procurators by appointing as king of Judea, one of
their own brethren&mdash;Agrippa.</p>


<h4>Agrippa's Youth.</h4>

<p>Agrippa was the grandson of Herod the Great and
Mariamne, thus having both Idumean and Hasmonean
blood in his veins. As a child he was sent for his education
to Rome. The influences of Rome were not healthy.
They made the lad luxurious and extravagant.
Loaded with debts he returned to Judea and was assisted
by his uncle and brother-in-law, Antipas, tetrarch
of Galilee. After varied fortunes he came again to
Rome, befriended by Philo's brother Alexander. Tiberius,
emperor at that time, received him favorably and
gave him charge of his grandson. But still his extravagant
habits continued, and an incautious word sent him
to prison, where he remained till the emperor died in 37.</p>

<p>The next emperor, Caligula, who was mad enough to
think himself a divinity, was also sane enough to make
Agrippa his friend and even to be dissuaded by him from
putting his statue in the Temple. Agrippa's fortunes
began now to rise. On the death of tetrarch Philip and
on the deposition of tetrarch Antipas, their Palestinian
provinces were bestowed on him (see p. 117). He was
honored with the titles of King and Praetor, and his iron
chain was exchanged for one of gold. So, like Joseph, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
was transferred from a prison to a throne. At Caligula's
death he assisted Claudius in obtaining the imperial
crown. In grateful recognition, Judea, Samaria and Idumea
were added to Agrippa's dominions. And thus it
happened that Judea had a king again.</p>


<h4>Agrippa the King.</h4>

<p>His kingdom, uniting the various tetrarchies of Herod's
three sons, was now even vaster in area than that
of his grandfather, Herod. But he was a very different
type of man. In spite of his Roman associations, he possessed
strong Jewish sentiment and decided to become
the father instead of the tyrant of his people.</p>

<p>The wild habits of his youth he laid aside and he hung
up in the Temple the golden chain that replaced his
prison fetters, as a mark of thankfulness and humility.
His rule was a golden age for Judea&mdash;all too brief.
Though partly of alien blood, the Pharisees said on one
occasion, "Thou art our brother, Agrippa." He was
amiable, benevolent, grateful and showed a forgiving
disposition. His magnanimity changed opponents into
friends.</p>

<p>He entered with hearty enthusiasm into all the ceremonial
of Judaism. The Mishna, explained in chap.
xxxi, speaks of him in high praise, and tells how he
carried the first fruit offering to the Temple with his
own hand. He looked after the interests of Jews and
Judaism at home and abroad. Through his representation,
some statues that had been wantonly put in a
Phoenician synagogue were removed. Still, outside of
Judea he permitted the amphitheatre with gladiatorial
combats, and bestowed gifts upon many Grecian cities
and upon some heathen towns of Palestine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>


<h4>Rabbi Gamaliel.</h4>

<p>The Sanhedrin was invested by him with new power
and dignity, and under the wise presidency of Rabbi
Gamaliel, <em>hazaken</em> (the elder), a descendant of Hillel
many liberal laws were made. Gamaliel showed the
same consideration to heathen as to Jewish poor. He
was so esteemed that the saying arose, "When Rabbi
Gamaliel died, the glory of the Torah passed away."
One of his teachings ran: "Procure thyself an instructor;
avoid the possibility of doubt; and do not tithe by conjecture."</p>


<h4>Agrippa Slain.</h4>

<p>Agrippa would fain have furthered the hopes of
Israel in making them more independent of Rome, but
he was watched by envious eyes. A conference of
local vassal kings, called by him, was broken up by the
suspicious Syrian governor. He wished to strengthen
Judea's fortifications, but again the Syrian governor
induced the emperor to stop the work. In fact, many
jealous Romans feared that a longer continuance of
his kingdom might develop into a menace against Rome.
So the assassin's knife was called into play! Suddenly
at a moment of triumphal glory, he was stricken down at
the early age of forty-five. The kindly disposed emperor
would have given the kingdom to his son, but he was dissuaded
by his counselors. The old regime of the hated
procurators was restored once more.</p>


<h4>Agrippa II.</h4>

<p>It is true this son, called Agrippa II. was given a
small dominion, but with little independent power. He
was also entrusted with the superintendence of the
Temple which he did not always exercise wisely. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was well-disposed to the Jews, and even used his influence
at court to intercede in their favor; but he felt
akin with them far less than had his father. He imported
wood for the Temple use and employed the discharged
workmen of the finished Herodian Temple to pave the
city with marble. At first, he did all he could in his
impotent way to prevent hostilities between Rome and
Judea, but his training had been Roman and his spirit
was pagan. He moved on the line of least resistance&mdash;that
meant his ultimate drifting toward victorious Rome.
His was a weak nature entirely under the control of his
sister Berenice. She became later a favorite of the Roman
emperor Titus, who played so large a part in Judea's
last days.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Note.</span></h4>

<p>Agrippa II. continued to hold his petty kingdom for
some time after Judea had fallen, and lived to read Josephus'
history about it. He was the Agrippa before
whom Paul appeared, and to whom he indolently said,
"With little wouldst thou win me over to be a Christian."</p>

<p>Paul also appeared before a later procurator, Felix.</p>

<p><br />Agrippa's death was a signal for general indignities
by Greeks and Romans throughout Palestine against
the people who had lost their defender. Burdensome
taxation alone would have been borne; but each in turn
of the second group of procurators placed over them
seemed actuated by the wanton purpose of trampling
upon everything the Jews held sacred, holding their religion
up to scorn, and forcing them into rebellion
through the madness of despair.</p>

<p><em>Fadus</em>, the first of the second group, was the most
harmless. A deluded enthusiast named Theudas claiming
to be the Messiah and to be gifted with supernatural
powers, was apprehended and put to death together with
many of his followers.</p>


<h4>The Zealots.</h4>

<p><em>Tiberius Alexander</em>, the next procurator, was a nephew
of Philo, but unlike his uncle, had abandoned Judaism,
and therefore was a very unfit appointee. He found it
necessary to put to death two sons of the Zealot Judas,
the Galilean. These Zealots already briefly referred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
were a group of irreconcilables that at times resorted to
desperate remedies. They were the advance guard of a
revolution. Rebellions continued to grow in gravity
with each successive rule. During the administration of
Ventidius Cumanus a rebellion broke out through the
wanton indecency of a Roman soldier during the Passover
celebration. In putting down the insurrection
Cumanus ordered many thousands slain. On another
occasion the Zealots started to lead an attack against
Samaria to punish the murder of some of their brethren,
for the base Cumanus allowed marauders to rove unmolested
on the payment of sufficient bribe. Against
the Zealots, however, he led an army, for their offenses
were political, not moral. Through the intervention of
young Agrippa, Cumanus was banished.</p>

<p>But the worst Procurator was to follow&mdash;<em>Felix</em>. He
goaded the Jews beyond endurance. All the appointees
to the procuratorship had been bad, but the appointment
of this man as Judea's ruler was an outrage. He was
a freedman, i. e., one from the low classes. His tyranny
in public and his lust in private life revealed his base
origin. How natural that Judah should come to hate
Rome when she was represented by such hateful creatures!
How natural that the rebellious element&mdash;the Zealots&mdash;should
grow in number and determination. These
Felix punished with cruel recklessness, resorting often to
treachery to entrap them. By such doing he fomented
the evil. Rebellion was now rife and could no longer
be quelled.</p>


<h4>The Sicarii.</h4>

<p>For a still more fanatical group now made their appearance&mdash;outcome
of these unhappy times. They were called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<em>Sicarii</em>, from the short dagger, <em>sica</em>, with which they
secretly slew their opponents. These political assassinations
made Jerusalem unsafe. Felix was even unscrupulous
enough to make use of these desperate men
to slay the High Priest Jonathan, whose influence had
brought about his own appointment. His only crime
against Felix was begging him to administer his office
more worthily, and his only crime against the Sicarii
was not sanctioning their outrages. These wild, misguided
men were religious enthusiasts of a frenzied sort,
for wanton injustice breeds such types. They would
gather with crowds of deluded followers in the wilderness,
claiming a divine call to overthrow Rome; Felix always
had his cohorts ready to hew them down. He knew
no remedies other than bloodshed. In one instance an
Egyptian Jew appeared as a would-be deliverer. At once
Felix ordered a massacre. The leader escaped; some of
his surviving followers awaited his return as a Messiah,
who would re-establish the throne of David once more.</p>

<p>Gradually a large part of the nation was imbued with
the spirit of rebellion. The mismanagement of Felix
also brought quarrels among the priests. Conflict arose
in Caesarea between Syrians and Jews as to civic rights
and privileges. Felix partially decided in favor of the
Syrians and again increased the disturbance by resorting
to slaughter. In return for large bribes he deprived the
Jews of Caesarea of their civic rights, which they had
possessed from the days when the city was founded. At
last, having done all the mischief he could, this creature
was recalled in 60 by Emperor Nero.</p>

<p>His successor <em>Festus</em>, meant well, but could do little
in this demoralized state. Things had gone too far to be
smoothed over. The upheaval had to come. The Sicarii<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
continued their assassinations, regarding all the moderates
as their enemies.</p>

<p>At the death of Festus and after an interval of anarchy,
Albinus&mdash;a second Felix&mdash;was appointed&mdash;a public
plunderer, a bribe-taker from all parties. Well-to-do
criminals could buy their freedom from him; only the
poor remained in prison. The high-priesthood at this
time was held by a most unscrupulous man, Ananias, who
took by violence the tithes of the priests. At last Albinus
secretly joined the robber bands of Sicarii. When recalled
in 62, he maliciously opened all the prisons and
set the malefactors free to fill the country with lawless
men. How the lives and fates and fortunes of these
hapless Judeans were bandied about to gratify the wanton
lust of these tyrants and scoundrels!</p>

<p>The last procurator, <em>Gessius Florus</em>, held the post till
66 and then the storm burst. For the climax of outrageous
rule was reached in him. Josephus says that,
compared with him, Albinus whom he describes as "an
arch-robber and tyrant," was a law-abiding citizen and
to be praised as a benefactor! Need we add more? He
did not, as Albinus, even hide his crimes. His plunderings
were conducted by wholesale. He was verily a partner
of robbers. Surely the time for Judah to strike a blow
for freedom had come.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>JUDEA'S WAR WITH ROME.</h3>


<h4>Revolution.</h4>

<p>When Florus, after robbing the people, began openly
to rob the Temple, the last thread of endurance snapped.
Called in bitter irony a beggar, for whom forsooth alms
must be collected, Florus took a bloody revenge. A
second wanton attack upon the long suffering people
by his arriving cohorts, compelled them to rise against
the Roman soldiers in self defense. They gained possession
of the Temple Mount and Florus at last, seeing
the mischief he had effected, fled to Caesarea. Agrippa
tried hard to dissuade the people from a hopeless
struggle against Rome, but he was a man without influence.
The Temple offerings for the Roman emperor
were stopped&mdash;that was, so to speak, the official renunciation
of their allegiance. The more temperate could
not restrain the masses from this determination.</p>


<h4>A Peace Party.</h4>

<p>These moderates, who represented the judicious,
formed a "Peace Party." Conflict arose between them
and the advocates of war, in which Agrippa who aided
the former with his troops, had his palace burned and
his soldiers put to flight. Soon the fortress towers held
by the Roman soldiers had to yield and the garrison
was slain. The revolution extended to all the outlying
towns in which Jews and Gentiles fought against each
other, and spread even as far as Alexandria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The governor of Syria, Cestius Gallus, thoroughly
alarmed, came to Jerusalem with a picked army, but
after a partial success he was forced to retreat. So
vigorously was he pursued by these dauntless men,
that only by leaving most of his baggage behind him&mdash;of
great value to the revolutionists&mdash;could he escape
at all, and then with but a remnant of his army. This
unlooked for success left the Peace Party in a hopeless
minority. Roman allies could do naught but leave
the capital. The Jews now began to organize their
forces and some of the highest men in the city led in
the defense.</p>


<h4>Josephus.</h4>

<p>At an assembly of the people Joseph ben Gorion and
the High Priest Ananus were given charge of Jerusalem
itself. Two men of the high-priestly family were
sent as generals to Idumea. In Jerusalem the walls were
strengthened and the youths trained for soldiers.
Josephus, a man of but thirty years, later historian
of this war and known so far only as a scholar, was
sent to Galilee. Here he was to gather an army from
among the people and to meet the first brunt of Rome's
experienced hosts as they would arrive via Syria. For
the time being he was the governor of Galilee and appointed
greater and lesser councils to strengthen the
fortifications of all the cities. He had further to meet
the opposition to his appointment in the province itself,
chiefly by one John of Gischala, a leader bold and
violent. For Josephus was not entirely trusted. His attitude
was altogether too moderate to satisfy these determined
rebels. In his heart of hearts he realized the impossibility
of success. That very conviction at once unfitted
him for leadership.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>The Emperor Nero, hearing of the defeat of the
governor of Syria, entrusted the task of quelling the
rebellion to the experienced general, Vespasian. He
at once sent a garrison of six thousand to the important
Galilean city, Sepphoris, which took possession before
the Jewish army arrived. As the Roman host approached
Galilee, Josephus' untrained soldiers retreated
to the highlands, leaving the whole Galilean plain in
possession of Vespasian without his striking a blow.</p>

<p>Josephus sent word to Jerusalem that if he was to
meet the Romans, he must have an army. The request
came too late. His troops, such as they were, retired
to the fortress of Jotapata, north of Sepphoris. Vespasian
appeared before it and a desperate struggle
followed. Josephus was a skilful commander and his
men showed dauntless courage, but Rome on its side
had all the experience of war together with overwhelming
numbers. The first attack failed and a siege began.
Josephus showed wonderful craft in obtaining food for
his garrison and in breaking the force of the Roman
battering rams. But these means could only delay the
end; they could not change it. The besieged were worn
out by sleeplessness and starvation after holding out for
forty-seven days. The wall was scaled when the exhausted
watchmen were asleep. All were either slain
or sold into slavery. The city and its fortifications
were levelled to the ground.</p>

<p>Josephus with forty companions escaped to a cave.
Against his advice to surrender, they all decided that
they would die by their own hands. Josephus by strategem
alone managed to escape this fate. He appeared
before Vespasian and by adroit flattery was favorably
received into his camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>THE SIEGE.</h3>


<h4>The North Succumbs.</h4>

<p>When Vespasian reached Tiberias, on the Sea of Galilee,
the people opened their gates and at the request of
Agrippa&mdash;who had now wholly thrown in his fortunes
with the Romans&mdash;they were well treated. In the meantime
the army of Titus, son of Vespasian, took the city
of Tarichea.</p>

<p>Glance for a moment at the map of Palestine, (front
of book) so that a mental picture may be formed of the
territory involved in the great struggle: Phoenicia, the
Lebanon Mountains and Syria ran across the north. Immediately
south was the province of Galilee, partly
bordering on the Mediterranean and bounded on the
east by the province of Gaulonitis and Decapolis, the
Jordan and the Sea of Galilee being the dividing line.
Batanaea lay to the east again of Gaulanitis. Still
farther south was Judea, with the Jordan dividing it
from Perea. Idumea lay in the extreme south.</p>

<p>Vespasian was still in the north and next attacked
the strong fortress of Gamala in Gaulonitis. But after
an entrance was gained into the city, the Jews fought
so desperately that the Romans was repulsed with
severe loss and for a time were afraid to renew the
attack. But in a second determined sally it was taken.
At the same time Mount Tabor was taken by a Roman
force. There was now left in Galilee only one unconquered
fortress to be taken&mdash;Gischala. Its conquest was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
entrusted to Titus. Its gates were soon opened, but its
controlling spirit, John of Gischala, with his band of
Zealots escaped to Jerusalem. By the end of the year
67 all northern Palestine was in the hands of the Romans.</p>


<h4>Rival Parties in
Jerusalem.</h4>

<p>These defeats brought consternation to Jerusalem.
The leaders, who had been taken from the aristocracy,
were blamed and deposed. Some were imprisoned and
leaders from among the people were put in their place.
But the change was not made without bloodshed. Alas,
here was the beginning of a civil conflict as well&mdash;war
within war. Judea's cup of misery was full. John of
Gischala, the escaped Zealot, was soon at the head of
the extreme fanatic party. Fighting contingents of malcontents
came to Jerusalem from all over the country
and joined the Zealots, which thus became the ruling
power. They threw discretion to the winds. An ignorant
man of the common people was also chosen as High
Priest though this office had always been in the hands
of the aristocracy.</p>

<p>The Idumeans were now invited to enter Jerusalem
and join forces with the Zealots. They began at once a
bloody attack on the party of law and order. The
old leaders, men of high birth, were put to death. Verily
it was Judea's "reign of terror." After assisting in
all this mischief, the Idumeans departed. The new
Christian community also left Jerusalem, deserting their
brethren in the sore hour of need, and took refuge
in a heathen city. The shrewd Vespasian made no haste
to attack the capital, hoping that the opposing parties
left to themselves would weaken each other and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
his task more easy. He contented himself with placing
fortified garrisons in the chief surrounding places.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus163.jpg" width="350" height="485" alt="Titus" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Emperor Titus.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the meantime Nero died, in the year 68. Galba
was made emperor only to be murdered a few months
after. These events were watched by Vespasian with
keen eyes. The man who had the army with him
might win the purple. He therefore made a pause in
the war.</p>

<p>Another wild Zealot, Simon Ben Giora, began a
plundering expedition, carrying devastation wherever he
went. In 69, after a year's pause, Vespasian vigorously
renewed the struggle by subduing the remaining outlying
districts. There was now left for subjugation a
few fortresses and the capital.</p>

<p>Stopped from his robber raids by Vespasian's vigor,
Simon ben Giora was now hailed in Jerusalem. Here
all was confusion and demoralization. The reckless
tyrant of Gischala had indulged in terrible excesses. The
people hoped that the admission of Simon would rid
them of John's bloodthirsty rule; but there was little
choice between them.</p>

<p>Although Vitellius was now made emperor of Rome,
the armies in Egypt and Palestine decided to nominate
Vespasian. He hastened to Rome, found Vitellius
murdered, and his own candidature unopposed. So in
the year 70 he was acknowledged emperor by both east
and west, and the prosecution of the Judean war was
left in the hands of his son, Titus.</p>

<p>In Jerusalem the reign of terror continued. There
was now a third war party under one Eliezar. Each
regarded the two others as enemies, and each held a
certain portion of the city as jealously against the others
as against the Romans. Simon ben Giora held the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
part of the lower city situated on one hill, and the whole
of the upper city situated on another hill called Acra.
John of Gischala was entrenched in the Temple Mount.
Eleazar held the court of the Temple, but soon overpowered
by John was forced to join forces with him.
In the madness of their folly they played into the hands
of the Romans by destroying grain rather than let it
fall into the hands of their rivals.</p>

<p>Titus with an immense army appeared before the walls
of Jerusalem in the spring of the fatal year 70. Still he
by no means carried all before him. When we read of
the brave and stubborn resistance of the Jews in spite
of the unfortunate conflicts within, we can better realize
how successful their resistance might have been had
they presented a united front to the enemy.</p>

<p>The situation of the city had its natural advantages.
It was built on two hills with a ravine between, while
the Temple standing in spacious grounds, surrounded
on all sides by strong walls, was a citadel in itself. Attached
to it was the castle of Antonia. The upper and
lower divisions of the city had their own separate walls,
a town's main protection before the days of gunpowder.
There was a common wall around both divisions and
a third around the suburb, Bezetha.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Coin of the Reign of Titus,
About 73 c. e.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>When the battering rams of Titus began attacking
the outer walls in three places, John and Simon stopped
their feud and banded together at last to meet the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
enemy. It was only after desperate fighting for many
days that the Romans got possession of the first wall.
Five days later the second wall was taken, though the
enemy was held back for four days longer. Earth
defenses were now built by the legions of Titus against
the different fortifications, but no sooner were these
built than they fell, undermined by the vigilant Simon
and John.</p>

<p>Titus now applied new measures of severity. A
stricter siege was maintained. The city was reduced to
famine and poor creatures stealing out to gather food
were crucified in sight of the defenders. Then he built
a wall to shut off all possible escape and so tried to
starve them out. The sufferings of the besieged, vividly
portrayed by Josephus, were desperate indeed and led
to still more desperate remedies.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Note.</span></h4>

<p>How history repeats itself! The antagonism of the
masses to the aristocracy, characteristic of the French
Revolution, found its precedent in Judea's war against
Rome. But the motives were far from identical.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">&nbsp;</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>THE FALL OF JERUSALEM.</h3>


<p>Titus built new fortifications and this time the attempt
to destroy them was not successful. But no
sooner had the last city wall fallen under the catapults
shot from the Roman battering rams than a second wall
appeared behind it, built by the foresight of John of
Gischala. After many attempts this wall was scaled.
The Romans now reached the Temple walls and took
the Antonia tower, which they immediately destroyed.</p>

<p>During all this time the daily sacrifices were continued
in the Temple. In the presence of the grim
monsters, war and starvation, this religious obligation
was not forgotten. A proposition of surrender was
made at this dire hour, but the besieged would not yield.
For Titus chose an unfortunate ambassador&mdash;Josephus.
He was received with a storm of arrows, for he was regarded
by the warriors in Jerusalem as a traitor.</p>

<p>Now, within the narrower compass of the Temple site,
the siege was maintained, though it was but the beginning
of the end. First, ramparts were erected by Titus
against its outer walls; but these walls were so strong
that he could only gain admittance by burning down the
gates. Terrifically did the Jewish soldiers, wasted by
famine, contest every inch of the ground, giving to the
Romans many a repulse. But overwhelming numbers
told. Titus had decided to save the Temple, but his vandal
soldiers set it on fire. The attempts of Titus to
quench it were in vain. The beautiful structure of marble
and gold&mdash;monument of Herod's pride&mdash;was reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to ashes. While it was burning the Romans began an indiscriminate
slaughter of men, women and children.</p>

<p>John of Gischala and Simon ben Giora with a small
band, now fell back to the last refuge, the upper city.
Their request for liberty on condition of surrender was
refused. The lower city was now burnt and new ramparts
built against the last stronghold. Yet it took some
weeks before entrance was finally forced, and the Romans
continued their savage work of burning and massacre.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Depicting Carrying the Spoil of Judea.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The city was razed to the ground&mdash;a few gates of
Herod's palace and a piece of wall were alone left standing.
The survivors were sent to labor in unwholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
mines to gather wealth for their despoilers. Some were
reserved for Roman sport in the amphitheatre. John,
discovered in a subterranean vault and begging like a
craven for mercy, was imprisoned for life. Simon ben
Giora graced the Roman triumph.</p>

<p>Thus fell the city of Jerusalem&mdash;the religious capital
of the world&mdash;in the year 70 <small>C. E.</small>, on the same date it is
said&mdash;the 9th of Ab&mdash;on which it had fallen nearly seven
hundred years earlier under the attacks of the Babylonians.
So the Fast of Ab commemorates the double tragedy.</p>


<h4>Masada, the
Last Fortress.</h4>

<p>The final work of conquest and the barbaric rejoicings,
consisting of forced gladiatorial combats between Jewish
prisoners, together with games and triumphs, continued
some two years longer. There were still three
outlying strongholds to be conquered&mdash;Herodium, Macharus,
on the other side of the Dead Sea, and Masada,
far to the south. The first two soon fell, but Masada
offered a stubborn resistance which its natural position
favored. Under Eleazar ben Jair and some Sicarii the
dauntless bravery of Jerusalem and Jotapata was repeated.
They determined not to die by the swords of the
Romans, so when the soldiers entered they found the
little band all slain by their own hands.</p>

<p>On the site of the old Temple there was subsequently
built another, dedicated to Jupiter Capitolinus, and, with
a refinement of cruelty, the Jews throughout the Roman
dominions had to pay toward its maintenance the taxes
they had hitherto paid to the support of their own beloved
sanctuary. So ended the Israelitish nation that under
varied fortunes had continued unbroken, except during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the Babylonian captivity, since the days of Saul, i.e.,
for over a thousand years.</p>

<p>Judea remained a separate Roman province, but was
no longer a home for the people whose possession it
once was. So completely was it levelled to the ground
that there was nothing left to make those who came there
believe it had once been inhabited. Rebuilt at a latter
day, even the name was changed to Aelia Capitolina.
But great names cannot so easily be erased by the ruthless
hand of man.</p>


<h4>The Remnant
Again.</h4>

<p>What was now to become of the remaining Jews?
What was their status in the world? Nation, temple,
independence were gone. Gone too were their arms,
their means, their nobility, and all political power. Would
it not seem that this must be the end, that their name
and identity must be ultimately merged with their surroundings?
Such had been the fate of other nations
as completely conquered&mdash;Ammon, Moab, Assyria, Phoenicia.
But Israel was made of different stuff. Its epitaph
was not yet to be written.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span></p>

<p>In the history of Rome, the conquest of Judea occupies
a small place. It was only a little province in the
East! But Greece, which it had also conquered, was
insignificant in size. Still Hellas and Israel were the
greatest intellectual and spiritual powers in the world.
Rome itself received its education from the one and its
religion from the other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>JOSEPHUS AND HIS WORKS.</h3>


<p>What literature did this sad period produce? There
was neither heart nor leisure to turn to poetry or philosophy,
or even to write a second "Lamentations." But
in the prosaic field of history some important works
were produced by one individual, who hardly deserves to
be included in the fold of Israel&mdash;Josephus.</p>


<h4>His Early Life.</h4>

<p>He was born in Jerusalem in the year 38 <small>C. E.</small> under
the regime of the procurators; so he never knew an independent
Judea. Of studious bent, he was consulted
(so he tells us) on points of law at the early age of fourteen.
At the age of 26 he went to Rome like Philo, to
intercede with the Emperor Nero for some of his brethren,
falsely charged by the procurator, Felix. His persuasive
address and political shrewdness won the day. He
returned dazzled with the splendor and magnitude of the
city on the Tiber. He realized now the impossibility of
Israel undertaking a successful war against it. Therefore
he never should have been chosen to command one of
Judea's campaigns.</p>


<h4>Josephus
vs. Jeremiah.</h4>

<p>After the war he sought and obtained the liberty of
some of the captives. But he was satisfied to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Roman citizenship from the hand of the emperor who had
overthrown the Jewish State&mdash;Vespasian, and even appended
the emperor's first name, Flavius, to his own.
When we see him living at ease on a pension and a tax-free
estate given by Rome while his brethren were working
in the lead mines of Egypt or glutting the slave markets
of Europe we cannot but contrast his character with
that of Jeremiah who had been placed in similar circumstances
some centuries earlier.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus173.jpg" width="450" height="548" alt="Josephus" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Flavius Josephus.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>In the last days of the first nationality, when Babylonia
was thundering against the gates of Jerusalem,
Jeremiah had belonged to the Peace Party of his day,
not for reasons of expediency, such as actuated Josephus,
but from intense religious conviction. (See vol. iii, <cite>People
of the Book</cite>, chap. xxviii.) Nebuchadrezzar, regarding
this attitude as friendly toward Babylon, had offered
to Jeremiah ease and liberty after Judah was laid in the
dust. But he scorned to receive gifts from the enemies
of his country or to enjoy benefits through their misfortune.
Though Judah had rejected his advice and even
persecuted him for it, he made their lot his own, miserable
though it was. Like Moses, he died in the wilderness
with the generation who had brought that fate upon
themselves, because they lacked his faith.</p>


<h4>History of
the Jews.</h4>

<p>Let us forget Josephus the soldier; let us remember
Josephus the scholar. Though in his last years he may
possibly have lived as pagan, he certainly wrote as Jew.
He loved his people, but lacked the magnanimity to share
their misfortunes. This was his fatal weakness. Posterity
is grateful to Josephus for his History of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Jews, called "Antiquities of the Jews" in twenty volumes,
the writing of which may have formed the chief occupation
of his later years. Perhaps he felt that he might
yet serve Israel's cause in this way. He begins his chronicle
with the Bible records, which he embellishes with
many a Midrashic story such as that of Moses being given
choice of a plate of gold and of fire. He carries the
narrative right down to the procuratorship of Florus.
Writing for Greek and Roman readers, he sought to
give them a better and truer estimate of his people. Indeed,
in all his works, he never loses an opportunity to
defend the honor of Israel. In his next work, "Wars
of the Jews," in seven books, he begins with Antiochus
Epiphanes, thus duplicating part of his history. But the
first two books are but introductory to his real theme, the
war with Rome. This history is not only his greatest
work, but one of the greatest of antiquity. He presents
a vivid picture of the last scenes of Judea's death struggle,
of which he was an eye witness and in part an actual
participator. It is carefully and skilfully compiled and
as a contemporary record it is invaluable.</p>

<p>It was first written in his mother tongue, Aramaic,
(p. 69), and later rewritten in Greek. The work was
endorsed by Vespasian, Titus and Agrippa. It may be
said that such a man was not of fine enough character
to be an impartial historian; but impartial historians are
quite a modern institution. All ancient historians took
great liberties both with events and numbers, and put
speeches of their own composition in the mouths of the
leading characters.</p>

<p>In connection with this work we may mention his
autobiography, covering chiefly his questionable achievements
as commander-in-chief in Galilee in 66. It is his
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apologia pro vita sua</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>


<h4>Contra Apion.</h4>

<p>To his merit, be it further said, he gladly became the
advocate of his people in the land of the Gentile, and
jealously guarded their reputation. Against the traducer,
Apion, an Egyptian grammarian, he launched a work
in Israel's defense, "Josephus Against Apion," or "The
Great Age of the Jews," in the form of a letter to a
friend. It is in two books. In the first he replies to
other traducers of the Jewish people. For the bad fashion
had come into vogue of inventing absurd slanders
against the Jews&mdash;a fashion, by the way, that has not
yet passed away.</p>

<p>He easily refutes the charges of Manetho that the
Jews were expelled from Egypt as lepers. "If lepers
why should they have been kept so long as slaves."</p>

<p>Of Apion, the offender, who gives title to the book, he
says: His writings show palpable ignorance and malevolent
calumny; but as the frivolous part of mankind
exceeds the discerning, I find myself under some kind of
necessity to expose the 'errors of this man.' He shows
how Apion ridicules the Sabbath by misrepresenting its
origin.</p>

<p>To the slander that Jews worship a golden ass placed
in their holy of holies, he replies that such charge could
only have been brought by an Egyptian, for they <em>do</em>
worship animals.</p>

<p>He dismisses the preposterous charge that Jews annually
sacrifice a Greek, with the information that at the
time of Moses, "the Jews knew not the Greeks." How
old "the blood accusation" is!</p>

<p>But Josephus finds that the best and most dignified
reply to all aspersions on Israel lies in giving an outline
of their law and belief. This gives him an opportunity
to testify to the faith that is in him still. He writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There never was such a code of laws framed
for the common good of mankind as those of Moses&mdash;for
the advancement of piety, justice, charity, industry,
regulation of society, patience, perseverence
in well doing, even to the contempt of death itself."</p>

<p>"God is the source of joy and to Him they turn in
all woe. This worship of the one God is combined
with morals."</p>

<p>"They weekly gather even their servants and
children (on the Sabbath), having suspended work
to read the Law, that they might know what to do."</p></blockquote>

<p>He points out the sobriety of the Law, its strict chastity,
reverence for parents and elders, duties to the stranger,
moderation towards enemies, easement of prisoners,
especially women, kindness to animals and vigorous punishment
of sin. It regards death, he says, as a blessed
means of being transported from this life to a better.
Hence Israel's record of martyrdom:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Such is our reputation that there is hardly a
nation in the world that does not conform in some
respect to our example."</p>

<p>"How many there are of our captive countrymen
at this day, struggling under exquisite torments because
they will not renounce their laws nor blaspheme
the God of their forefathers."</p></blockquote>

<p>Like Philo, he regards Judaism as a universal religion
that should be accepted by all mankind.</p>

<p>His works are couched in simple and attractive style.
Written in Greek, they have been translated into all tongues.
They were read much by Christians of the Middle
Ages, who regarded Josephus as a second Livy; but till
recent years he has been neglected by his own people. But
then so was Philo.</p>

seem to indicate that, prior to the coming of Paul, Jesus

Jesus in the History of Josephus. But the clumsy forgery

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>JOCHANAN BEN ZAKKAI.</h3>


<p>The Jews now belonged to no land, yet for that very
reason, they, in a sense, belonged to all lands. They were
cosmopolitans, citizens of the world. To follow their
history after their dispersion by Rome, we shall have to
turn to all the settled parts of the globe. What henceforth
became the link to hold together their widely scattered
members and preserve them from being absorbed
by their surroundings? Their religion. Religions outlive
states and spiritual bonds are stronger than temporal.
But now that Judaism's centre, the Temple, was no more,
now that the sacred capital, Jerusalem, the only sanctioned
place for sacrificial worship, was lost&mdash;how could they
maintain their continuity and what would become of their
priesthood? Just here will we witness the wonderful
adaptability of Judaism in the hands of this deathless
race. It only awaited a genius to revive the Faith, apparently
in the throes of death, and to endow it with new
strength and vitality. The hero who undertook this sacred
task was named Jochanan ben Zakkai.</p>


<h4>The Academy
at Jamnia.</h4>

<p>Jochanan ben Zakkai had been a leader in the Sanhedrin,
in the last days of Judea. When many were urging
war he had stood for peace and he became the exponent
of the Peace Party. For he saw that the madness of the
Zealots in blindly plunging the country into conflict could
end only in ruin. He may have felt, too, that the fulfilment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of Israel's mission did not rely on national independence
and that it could preach its message in a way other
than in bloody conflict. So when the war was at its
height, he managed to escape from Jerusalem in a coffin,
since the Zealots treated all peace advocates as traitors.
Welcomed by Vespasian, who saw the value of so influential
a pleader for surrender, he was allowed to ask
a favor. His reply showed that he was not of the Josephus,
but of the Jeremiah type. He asked naught for
himself, but pleaded for the privilege of establishing an
<em>Academy</em>, where the principles of Judaism might be
taught. This small request was granted, perhaps contemptuously
at its apparent insignificance. Yet by that
grant Judaism was enabled to continue its development&mdash;aye,
to outlive the great Roman Empire at whose mercy
it now stood.</p>

<p><em>Jamnia</em>, a place near the Mediterranean and not far
from Joppa, was chosen as the seat of the new academy.
Here came many who, being of the conciliatory party,
were left free and untouched by Rome at the close of
the War. Here Jochanan ben Zakkai summoned a Sanhedrin,
and by a bold stroke decided to continue the
authoritative powers of that body in spite of the tradition
that to be effective, it must sit in the "hewn stone hall"
of the Jerusalem Temple.</p>


<h4>Prayer replaces
Sacrifice.</h4>

<p>But he took a more daring step still. According to
the Law, now that the Holy City was taken, sacrifice
was no longer possible; therefore Jochanan ben Zakkai
declared that it was no longer indispensable; saying,
charity is a substitute for sacrifice. Prayer, which had
been an accompaniment to sacrifice was now treated as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
an independent mode of worship. The synagogue, which
had in later years existed side by side with the sacrificial
Temple, now altogether replaced it. Thus does genius
adapt itself to altered conditions.</p>

<p>The change was revolutionary and marked a new era
in Judaism's development. The epoch of the Priest was
over, the Altar was outlived&mdash;one of the ideals of the
Prophets was attained. Again necessity was the teacher
and adversity was found to "wear a precious jewel in its
head." Furthermore, the creation of a centre of Jewish
authority outside of Jerusalem freed Judaism from bondage
to a particular locality. Its complete fulfilment was
now confined neither to a city nor a nation. The whole
earth could become its legitimate home. This also had
its moral value. To the simple-minded it made clearer
the idea that God was manifest everywhere; that verily
"the heaven was His throne and the earth His footstool."
It gave tangible application to the text, "In every place
where I cause my name to be remembered, I will come
unto thee and bless thee."</p>

<p>So the survival of Judaism after the destruction of
the sacrificial Temple, after the loss of the sacred capital
and the Holy Land, and after the dispersion of the Jews
throughout the world, made it more manifest that it was
indeed a perennial and a universal Faith. Perhaps then
even in this sad tragedy we may discern the hand of
Providence.</p>

<p>It is true that some pious souls took a disconsolate view
of the outlook and, renouncing the world's joys, gave
themselves up to ascetic lives of penitence. A few drifted
toward the new Christian sect that was now severing all
relations with Judaism, thinking it doomed. But under
the guidance of Jochanan ben Zakkai, the great majority
faced the future more hopefully and more bravely. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
land was gone, but the religion was saved. Henceforth
its rallying centre was to be&mdash;not a <em>Temple</em>, but a <em>Book</em>.</p>


<h4>The Tannaim.</h4>

<p>We have already seen that the Scribes interpreted the
Bible in a way to derive from it new laws to meet new
needs, (pp. 19-20; 80-81.) These deduced rules grew
into a Second Law, more voluminous than the first. The
patient continuance of this process to meet all religious,
social and economic requirements of Israel's altered life
became now the chief work of the Jamnia Academy and
of other schools that sprang from it. To this work of
laying bare "the whole duty of man" the scholars now
devoted themselves and regarded it as sacred as divine
worship. "The study of the Law," said they, "outweighs
all virtues." The first order of these great expounders were
called <em>Tannäim</em> (<em>tanna</em> means teacher). Very preciously
did the students who sat at the feet of the sages treasure
their decisions (for they were contained in no book)
and handed them down from generation to generation.</p>

<p>The people at large now learned to look to the Jamnia
Sanhedrin, for such it became, as their authority in all
religious duties and also for guidance in varied perplexities.
In those days there was no fixed calendar; the new
month was ascertained by watching the heavens for the
new moon and from the date of its appearance the Sanhedrin
decided the festivals of each month for the community.
The new moon was announced from place to
place by messengers and fire signals on the hills. These
could not reach distant places of Jewish settlement far
beyond Judea, and, in some cases the signals were tampered
with. So, as there was a doubt of one day as to
the new moon's appearance, they introduced the custom
of observing an additional day of each festival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>


<h4>Halacha and Agada.</h4>

<p>Jochanan ben Zakkai, then, revealed his greatness in
boldly abrogating institutions that had lost their application
with the Temple's fall, bridging the transition between
epochs, just as Samuel had done in his day. His
great personality strengthened the union between the
dispersed Jews. Further, like his master Hillel, he combined
in his character gentleness and firmness (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suaviter
in modo, fortiter in re</i>) and like him, too, he also exercised
an elevating influence on his pupils by his ethical
teachings. He showed them how to search the Scriptures
to discover its noblest lessons. This was distinct from
that branch of the Bible study already referred to, enabling
the student to evolve new rules and new observances.
The latter was judicial, the former homiletic. These gradually
came to form the two great divisions of the scholarly
activities of the Rabbis, the judicial division called
<em>Halacha</em> (legal decision), the ethical styled <em>Agada</em>. This
latter word means narrative&mdash;for many a story, anecdote,
moral maxim or bit of history would be brought in to
illustrate a legal point or to relieve the tension of argument
by a pleasing diversion. So Agada implied much
miscellaneous material and included everything not strictly
judicial.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here are some of the maxims of Jochanan ben Zakkai:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No iron tool was to be used on the altar, suggesting
that religion's mission is peace."</p>

<p>"If thou hast learnt much, do not boast of it, for
that wast thou created."</p>

<p>"Fear God as much as you fear man."</p>

<p>"Not more?" asked his pupils in surprise? "If
you would but fear him as much!" said the dying
sage.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Notes and References.</span></h4>


<h5><em>Sacrificial Worship</em>:</h5>

<p>The pupil has already been made familiar with the
prophetic views on sacrifice (see <cite>People of the Book</cite>, vol.
iii). Here follow some opinions of the Rabbis as to its
relative place in Judaism:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The humble-minded is considered by God to have
offered all the sacrifices, for it is said that the sacrifices
of God are a broken spirit."</p>

<p>"Acts of justice are more meritorious than all
the sacrifices. Unless the mind is purified, the sacrifice
is useless; it may be thrown to the dogs."</p>

<p>"He who engages in the study of the Law, requires
neither burnt offering nor meal offering."</p>

<p>"A day in thy courts is better than a thousand,"
Psalm lxxiv. is thus explained: God said to David,
"I prefer thy sitting and studying before me to the
thousands of burnt offerings which thy son Solomon
will offer on the alter."</p>

<p>"He who prays is considered as pious as if he had
built an altar and offered sacrifices upon it."</p>

<p>"As the Altar wrought atonement during the time
of the Temple, so after its destruction, the Table of
the home."</p></blockquote>

<p>With the abolition of sacrifice, the Paschal Lamb was
indicated only in a symbolic way by a lamb bone on the
Passover table.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>R. Jochanan b. Zakkai asked his disciples: "Find out
what is the best thing to cultivate." The first replied a
generous eye; the second, a loyal friend; the third, a
good neighbor; the fourth, prudence and foresight; the
fifth, Eliezar, a good heart. "I consider R. Eliezar's
judgment best, for in his answer all of yours are included."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>


<h4><em>Theme for discussion</em>:</h4>

<p>Whether the Temple's fall suspended or abolished animal
sacrifice is a point of difference between Judaism's
two schools today.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>THE PALESTINIAN ACADEMIES.</h3>


<p>Jamnia was the first of many Palestinian schools; one
was located at Sepphoris, another at Tiberias, both in
Galilee; another at Lydda in the south not far from the
Mediterranean. So the good work grew, and under sadder
auspices the thread of life was taken up again. A
new royalty, so to speak, was created in Israel. The
first literal royalty of the House of Judah had been overthrown
by Babylon seven hundred years earlier. After
the restoration, the priests became the monarchs of the
state, exercising almost regal powers. Now in the dispersion
the teacher was king. Rabbi Simeon taught:
"There are three crowns: the crown of the Law, the
crown of the priesthood, and the crown of royalty; but
the crown of a good name excelleth them all."</p>

<p>The head of the Academy was called Nasi (prince),
also Patriarch. His sway was voluntarily yet gladly
accepted in matters both religious and civil (as far as
the management of internal affairs was granted) by the
congregations in Rome, Babylonia, Greece, Egypt and
the Parthian lands.</p>


<h4>Rabban Gamaliel II.</h4>

<p>The first Nasi at Jamnia was Rabban Gamaliel II.
of the family of Hillel, for Jochanan ben Zakkai had
held a unique position, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>, demanded by the exigencies
of the time. But it was the wish of all that the
official position should remain in the House of Hillel.</p>

<p>Gamaliel was noted both as scholar and man. He was
so conscientious that in farming his estate he would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
no interest. He was so expert as easily to master the astronomical
and mathematical knowledge needed for the
regulation of the Jewish calendar. He was a stern man,
but these troublous times needed a firm hand, religiously
as well as civilly, for it was a period of unrest; the air
was full of schemes and fantastic notions. Even so, he
was perhaps too severe, and for a brief period during his
thirty years of Patriarchate, he was actually deposed;
the incident will be related presently. One indication of
his severity was his frequent imposition of <i>Niddui</i>&mdash;excommunication.
The person so condemned had to remain
aloof from the community and live as one in mourning.
He was thus ostracised until the ban was removed.</p>

<p>As in the days when the Temple stood, there were still
two parties&mdash;Hillelites and Shammaites. Rabban Gamaliel,
however, endeavored to place himself above party, as
the leader should.</p>

<p>The following incidents will show the temper of these
Jewish scholars: One Akabiah ben Mahallel was asked
to recede from a particular decision. It was even intimated
by some that if he would yield, he would be made
<em>Ab Beth Din</em> (Vice-President, next in order to the Nasi).
To this suggestion he answered, "I would rather be a
fool all my life than a rogue for one hour." Is not that
magnificent? Living aloof and asked by his son for a
letter of recommendation to his colleagues, the stern father
refused. "Thine own works must recommend thee."</p>

<p>Another famous teacher was Eliezer ben Hyrcanus,
who opened the school at Lydda. His weakness lay in
the fact that he would never trust his own judgment to
deduce a rule. He accepted and taught only what he had
learned on the authority of his teachers. That type of
man has its value in the world and is like the priest, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
treasures past traditions. But we need originators too,
who boldly open up new highways; for if we mistrusted
our own powers altogether and walked only in the old
paths, knowledge would not grow and the world would
not advance. Rabbi Eliezer taught: "Thy fellowman's
honor must be as dear to thee as thine own. Do not allow
thyself to be easily angered. Repent one day before
thy death."</p>


<h4>R. Joshua.</h4>

<p>In contrast, let us single out a more interesting figure,
a man who left his impress on his age&mdash;Rabbi Joshua
ben Hananiah. Broad, versatile and gifted, he as a
youth had been a chorister in the Temple, now laid
waste. His mother, like Samuel's, destined him for a
religious life from his birth. Like a true genius, he broke
through many of the disadvantages that handicapped
him and became one of the Tannäim and the founder of a
new academy at Bekiim. He was miserably poor and
eked out a scanty existence as a needle-maker. For these
great teachers received no emolument for their labors in
the religious Academy. It was a service of love. They
followed the principle laid down by Rabbi Zadok, "Do
not use the Law as a crown to shine therewith or a spade
to dig therewith." Rabbi Joshua was, however, so severely
plain that a Roman emperor's daughter, combining
at once a compliment and an insult, asked why so much
wisdom should be deposited in so homely a vessel. Tradition
says he advised her to put her father's wine in golden
jars with a lamentable result, to prove that, good
wisdom, like good wine, may be best preserved in plain
receptacles.</p>

<p>Many of the scholarly leaders belonged to the Jewish
aristocracy, that was still prized even in their fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
state. Joshua was a man of the "common people." Yet
that became for him a source of power, as, being closer
to the masses, he was the better able to influence them,
and he helped to bring the upper and lower classes closer
together. By his gentleness and moderation he prevented
many a split in Judaism that often threatened when divergence
of view reached the danger point.</p>

<p>Although, like Gamaliel, a great mathematician and
astronomer, he was modest and obedient and submitted to
a humiliating ordeal imposed by this stern Nasi because
of a mistaken calculation as to the date of a holy day.
He must travel with purse and staff on the very day, according
to his error, Yom Kippur would have fallen. He
came. Gamaliel embraced him and said, "Welcome,
my master and my pupil; my master in wisdom and my
pupil in obedience." Such examples by great teachers
were most beneficial to the people at large.</p>

<p>Very valuable to the cause, too, was his shrewd and
common sense that exposed the folly of extreme and fantastic
views. "The Law," said he, "was not revealed to
angels but to human beings." Some misguided pietists
would not partake of wine or meat because, now that
the Temple had fallen they could not be offered at its altar.
"Why not," said he, "abstain also from bread and
water since they too were used in the sacrificial service?"
Nothing like ridicule at times to explode fallacies.</p>

<p>Most important perhaps of all his service was his endeavor
to close the breach between Israel and the Romans,
which the unforgiving Shammaites would have widened.
He advised a graceful submission to the inevitable.
In consequence he enjoyed the confidence of the Roman
rulers. Like Jochanan ben Zakkai, he turned out to be
the man of the hour; and when a little later Israel again
sailed into stormy seas, he was called to the helm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Rabbi Ishmael ben Elisha deserves a brief mention as
one of the great Tannäim of this age who, avoiding
strained interpretation, explained the Law with logical
common sense. He gladly devoted his wealth to the maintenance
of girls orphaned by the war. He too founded
a School and was destined, alas, to die a martyr's death.</p>


<h4>Ordination of Rabbis.</h4>

<p>These men and others like them assured the continuity
of their holy work by training students in the exploration
of the Law and transmitting to them the <em>Halachoth</em>
that they thus far deduced. When proficient, they were
ordained as teachers by the ceremony of <em>Semicha</em> (laying
on of hands). This gave them right of membership
in the Sanhedrin and certain judicial functions, and also
the title of <em>rabbi</em>, introduced after the Temple's fall by
Jochanan ben Zakkai.</p>

<p>Outside of Judea, schools were also being established
in Babylon, Parthia, Asia Minor and Egypt. In Alexandria
a modest academy replaced the pretentious Temple
of happier days. But all turned to Jamnia, where
the Sanhedrin met as the centre of religious authority.
It was for the time being their spiritual capital. To the
presiding Nasi, Rome granted some civil jurisdiction in
the administration of internal Jewish affairs. So the
Sanhedrin was still quite a House of Legislature in its
way.</p>


<h4>The Prayer Book.</h4>

<p>Here were regulated the institutions of Judaism and
here was now more completely formulated the ritual of
prayer already inaugurated in the synagogues while the
Temple stood. Here is its outline:</p>

<p>(a) <em>The Shema</em> the prayer beginning "Hear, O Israel,"
(Deut. vi. 4-9), was the centre of the first division<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of the service. It was <em>preceded</em> by two benedictions, the
first expressing God's providence seen in Nature, in the
morning for the glory of light, in the evening for the
soft restfulness of night; the second God's love for Israel
manifested in the bestowal of the Law. The Shema was
<em>followed</em> by another benediction voicing gratitude for
divine redemption. (b) The second division of the service
was called <em>Tefillah</em>, the "eighteen benedictions" prayer,
containing a set form of praises at the opening and
close, with the central part variable to fit the different occasions
of week-days, Sabbath and Holy Days. (c) The
third section of the service was the reading from the
Pentateuch and the Prophets.</p>

<p>The Reader was no special official; any Israelite could
"stand before the Ark" where the scrolls were placed,
and read the service. Here again prevailed the idea
that religious service was not to be paid for. Prayer for
the restoration of the Land and Temple was now a fixed
feature of every service. Perpetually to commemorate
the Temple's loss by outward signs, such as shattering
a glass at a wedding, became a duty in which patriotism
and religion were blended. Two of the fasts instituted
in Babylon for the fall of the first Temple were given a
second sad sanction now, to commemorate the downfall
of the second.</p>

<p>As may be well understood, a long and disastrous war
had demoralized the masses, especially the country folk.
The educated classes rather held aloof from the <em>Am
Haaretz</em>, "people of the soil," i.e., the ignorant masses.
This is rather surprising on the part of the scholars,
otherwise so conscientious and so benevolent. But the
times were rude and ignorance usually went hand in hand
with many evil practises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Notes and References.</span></h4>


<h5><em>The Prayer Book</em>:</h5>

<p>The ritual scheme given in this chapter was gradually
amplified by passages from Scripture especially Psalms,
by additional introductory and closing prayers and by
poems for the Festivals.</p>

<p>See Singer translation of the old <cite>Prayer Book</cite>; also
the <cite>Union Prayer Book</cite>, closer to the ancient, shorter
ritual.</p>

<p>In addition to complete services, the rabbis drew up a
series of Benedictions for daily occurrences. Darmesteter
thus puts it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Each day, each hour is unalterably arranged by
regulations from on high ... benedictions before
the meal, after the meal benedictions. At sight of
the imposing phenomena of nature, of a storm, the
sea, the first spring blossoms, thanksgivings.
Thanksgiving for new enjoyment, for unexpected
good fortune, on eating new fruits, at the announcement
of a happy event. Prayers of resignation at
the news of misfortune. At the tomb of a beloved
being, set prayers; words all prepared to console
the sorrow-stricken. Every emotion and every feeling,
the most fugitive as well as the most profound,
are foreseen, noted and embodied in a formula of
prayer ... sanctifying the present hour and keeping
one in perpetual communication with the divine."</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>JUDAISM AND THE CHURCH.</h3>


<h4>The Development
of Christianity.</h4>

<p>In the meantime the new religion that had sprung
from Judaism was entering its second stage of development.
We have seen (p. 133) how its adoption of pagan
ideas tended to separate Jews from Christians theologically.
We will now see how the trend of events tended
to separate them socially. There were still two Christian
sects&mdash;the pagan Christians, many of them Greeks,
to whom Jesus was the Son of God, whose blood shed
on the cross was an atonement for the sins of mankind
and whose coming abrogated the Law. These had small
sympathy with the Jews in spite of the fact that it was
the lofty morality of the Hebrew Scriptures that formed
the backbone of the new Faith.</p>

<p>On the other hand there were the Jewish Christians,
the original group, but now the small minority, who remained
Jews in all respects, but clung to the belief that
Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah, that he had risen
from the grave and would come a second time to gratify
the hopes not fulfilled in his first advent. They also fostered
the belief that they could cure by miracles and
drive out demons by declaration of a formula of their
faith; for Jesus had also believed in this power of exorcism.
They still maintained to a degree the customs of
the Essenes (from which body, perhaps they may have
been an outgrowth),&mdash;particularly the duty of voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
poverty. Indeed, the Sanhedrin seriously considered
whether they might not be regarded as Jews.</p>

<p>But when Judaism and Jews became discredited
through loss of land and Temple and Jews were taxed
for the privilege of remaining loyal to the former, these
Jewish Christians began to drift away from a people who
had lost power and status in the world, and threw in their
lot with the controlling majority. Such is the way of
the world. Furthermore, some of the Jewish country
folk, losing faith in the validity of Judaism through the
loss of its Temple, were attracted to Christianity with
its new scheme of salvation, in which Jesus took the
place which had been filled by the altar of sacrifice. In
this way many of the Gentile proselytes to Judaism in
Alexandria and Asia Minor went over to the new creed.
So the loss of the Temple with its priestly service had
much to do with the spread of Christianity.</p>

<p>Although great bitterness at first existed between the
two Christian sects, the pagan branch soon absorbed
the small Jewish branch and all too soon the Christians
"knew not Joseph." For the antagonism of Gentile
against Jew was now transmitted to the new church and,
sad to say, it became a more bitter persecutor of the people
from which Jesus and Paul had sprung than most of
the heathen nations had been.</p>


<h4>Old and New Testaments.</h4>

<p>New ceremonials grew up in the new faith. Passover
was turned into the Easter sacrificial service. The
unleavened bread and wine were supposed to be transformed
in some mystic way into the flesh and blood of
the Savior (as Jesus was styled). Many Roman rites
and symbols were consciously or unconsciously taken up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
by the new creed in the first few centuries of its foundation;
for it grew less and less Jewish as the years went
on. Depreciation of Judaism became now the accustomed
tactics of the Church Fathers, for Christianity's justification
depended in some respects on the theory of Judaism's
insufficiency. Jews were said to be blind and obstinate
in still clinging to the Law, now that Jesus had
come. This unfortunate spirit of antagonism to the parent
faith pervades the Christian Scriptures and mars its
ethical teachings. These Scriptures were known as the
<em>New Testament</em>, to distinguish them from the Jewish
Scriptures which were called the <em>Old Testament</em>; the
theory being that the testament or <em>covenant</em> between
God and Israel, there recorded, was now obsolete and
superseded by a "new" covenant in which, as already explained,
belief in Jesus, the Messiah, took the place of
obedience to the Law. Many passages from the Psalms
and Prophets were retranslated to fit the impression that
they had really foretold the coming of Jesus and the
events of his life. The whole Hebrew Bible in fact was
treated as but a preparation for Christianity's grand
climax! Even the history of Israel was regarded as but
an allegorical picture of the life of the man of Nazareth.</p>


<h4>Gnostics.</h4>

<p>We cannot pass this period of religious upheaval, without
a word about certain strange sects, neither wholly
Jewish, Christian nor pagan, but something of all, that
arose at this time. They were for the most part called
Gnostics, from the Greek "know," claiming to obtain
through weird processes a clearer knowledge of God.
Very fantastic were the views of some on the problems
of life and sin. Some of the sects were led into all sorts
of absurdities and excesses. A few Jews were seduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
by these fascinating heresies, notably one Elisha ben
Abuyah, learned in the Law though he was. Having
left the fold, he is said to have became a persecutor of
his people. The Rabbis only accounted for the sad
change by a complete revolution in his nature&mdash;so they
called him <em>Acher</em>, "another man."</p>

<p>The Sanhedrin found it wise to prohibit the reading
of such mystic literature that would tend to lead youth
astray from the sound and healthy teachings of Judaism.</p>

<h4><br />Proselytes Again.</h4>

<p>The Emperor Vespasian, who had permitted the institution
of the Jamnian Academy, was succeeded by his
son Titus. Titus lived too briefly after he became emperor
to exert a decided influence on Israel, but it could
never forget that to his hand had been entrusted the final
overthrow of Judea. His brother Domitian, however,
the next emperor, was a tyrant and a degenerate. It is
said that at one time he contemplated the extermination
of the Jews. The Jewish tax (<em>Fiscus Judaicus</em>) was collected
with needless cruelty and indignity. He bitterly
persecuted those Romans who in spite of Israel's fallen
fortunes, were still drawn to its Faith and made severe
laws against those who encouraged conversion. Proselytes
came in sufficient numbers to make the subject an important
theme of discussion in the Jewish Academy. It
was probably in Rome itself where the spread of Judaism
most alarmed the emperor. Perhaps its teachings
reached the Romans through the Jewish prisoners of
war. Certainly many high born Romans were enthusiastically
prepared to make sacrifices for its cause. It
is said that even Flavius Clemens and his wife Flavia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Domitilla, relatives of Domitian and possible heirs to the
throne, were pledged to Judaism. Clemens was put to
death and his wife was exiled. But a step, and Judaism
might have mounted the imperial throne of Rome and
have exchanged destinies with Christianity. Perhaps not
even then, for its unbending monotheism and strict Law
brooked no easy compromise. However, it is one of the
might-have-beens of history.</p>

<p>One of the most famous proselytes was Aquila, a Greek
of scholarship and wealth. Dissatisfied with the later
Greek translations of the Bible, distorted to fit Christian
doctrine, Aquila made a literal translation from the Hebrew
that so commended itself to the Rabbis that it became
the "authorized version," so to speak, for the Synagogue.
An Aramaic (p. 60) translation of the Bible,
following his model, was called after him <em>Targum Onkelos</em>&mdash;which
means "a translation like that of Aquila."
It is often printed with the Hebrew texts of Scripture
to-day.</p>


<h4>Revolt against
Trajan.</h4>

<p>It was the unhappy fate of Israel that the mischievous
Domitian should have reigned so long and that the good
Emperor Nerva, his successor, should have reigned so
briefly. So although the injunctions against proselytes
were removed during the sixteen months of Nerva's rule
as soon as Trajan came to the throne many anti-Jewish
laws were restored. Like Alexander the Greek, Trajan
the Roman cherished the wild desire of conquering Asia.
When he attacked Parthia, the Jews living in semi-independence
there became his most vigorous opponents.
In Babylon they stubbornly held the city of Nisibis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
against his legions. No sooner had he subdued the lands
on the Euphrates and the Tigris than the Persian provinces
revolted.</p>

<p>All the Jews of the Diaspora now seized the occasion
to throw off the hated Roman yoke. For they had never
become reconciled to it; and, their children, now grown
to manhood, had been brought up in the assurance that
soon Judea would be won back again and the Temple
rebuilt. "Carthage must be destroyed" had been the
Roman cry; "Jerusalem must be rebuilt" was now the
Jewish. In Egypt, in Cyprus, a Mediterranean island,
and in Cyrene, further west on the African coast&mdash;they
rose against their opponents. At first success came to
their arms, though much blood flowed on both sides; but
there could be no doubt of the ultimate outcome with
Rome's overwhelming numbers. Yet so vigorous was
their resistance that the historian Graetz ventures to think
that, in spite of lacking cavalry and being indifferently
armed, had these three separate Jewish uprisings been
organized under one directing control it would have gone
hard with the Roman legions. As it was, their beautiful
synagogue in Alexandria was destroyed, all the Jewish
inhabitants of Cyprus were slain and the island forbidden
them in the future. Many lives were lost in other
places of Jewish insurrection, including Judea itself. The
revolt certainly nipped in the bud Trajan's foolish ambition
to conquer all Asia, and he died in mortification at
his failure.</p>

<p>Gamaliel was now dead and Rabbi Joshua had become
Patriarch. The reins of power could not have been entrusted
to wiser hands, for he seized the moment of the
accession of the new emperor, Hadrian, to counsel conciliation.
Like Jochanan ben Zakkai, he saw the futility
of Israel wasting its strength in fighting with colossal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
Rome. The Sanhedrin was removed from Jamnia to
Oosha in upper Galilee. Joshua's sway was less rigorous
than that of Gamaliel. At a time when many of his
brethren felt nothing but hatred toward the heathen, he
uttered the famous dictum: "The virtuous of all peoples
have a share in the heavenly bliss of the life to come."
This has since been accepted by the House of Israel as
the classic expression of its attitude towards other religions.</p>

<p>The new emperor Hadrian also seemed at first inclined
to a policy of concession; but there was little choice, for
revolt burst out in all parts of the empire, from Asia
Minor in the East to Britain in the far West. The discouraged
emperor gladly met many of his enemies half
way. Parthia was restored to the control of its own
princes. In Judea proper a cruel general, Quietus, was
checked in his terrible purpose of exterminating the
Jews and was ultimately executed.</p>


<h4>Hadrian's "Promise."</h4>

<p>To win peace and adherents, Hadrian was willing to
make many fair promises at the opening of his reign that
he had no serious intention of fulfiling. One of these
was an offer to the Jews to rebuild their Temple, which
they had exacted as the condition of laying down their
arms. Imagine the boundless joy with which this news
was received&mdash;a Cyrus come to power once more! Hebrew
poets sang of the glories that were to come. Christians
and Samaritans were much disconcerted at the
news.</p>

<p>But as soon as Hadrian had obtained the mastery of
the situation and quiet was restored, he resorted to subterfuge.
They might rebuild their Temple, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
in the same place! He knew it was that place or none.
The Jews saw through the pretense; their hopes were
blasted. There was talk of war again, but the wise Rabbi
Joshua still counselled submission. So for many years
the embers of revolt slumbered in the breasts of the
Jews, but did not die out, though as long as Rabbi Joshua
lived they did not break into flame.</p>

<h5><em>Proselytes</em>:</h5>

<p>Read the article on this subject in the <cite>Jewish Encyclopedia</cite>
for fuller list of Roman proselytes. Notice here
first, the different degrees of proselytism; secondly, the
attitude of the synagogue toward the convert, favorable
or unfavorable in different periods of its history, varying
with its changing relations with the outside world. Based
on the laws given to Noah (Genesis ix) the Tannäim
deduced seven Noachian rules, which they regarded as
obligations binding on all mankind. To these humane
laws strangers living in their midst must conform. For
they felt this sense of responsibility to those not of their
religion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<h3>AKIBA.</h3>


<h4>Love and Law.</h4>

<p>The man who now came to the fore was of a different
mould&mdash;the famous Rabbi Akiba. He was born in Palestine
in the year 50 <small>C. E.</small> that is, some 20 years before
the Temple fell. Many a pretty legend is woven around
his life. Have you ever realized that it is only around
great men that legends most luxuriantly grow? Imagination
does not seek to picture incidents in the lives of
the commonplace. Not only poor, but ignorant, Akiba
despised scholars and scholarship. One day, so runs the
story, this humble shepherd met Rachel, the beautiful
daughter of his master, Kalba Sabua, and fell in love
with her. Angry at his daughter's attachment for this
boor, the rich Kalba disinherited her. Her sweet self-sacrifice
in sharing poverty with him rather than wealth
without him, roused the noblest qualities dormant in Akiba's
nature. She was determined to bear yet further privation
that he might become a scholar in the Law. For
it was to his ignorance, rather than to his poverty, that
the father had objected. Among no people was illiteracy
so great a disgrace as among the Jews, and among none
did learning simply, confer so much honor. So at her
urgency, he reluctantly left his home to sit at the feet of
the Rabbis of the Schools. The chronicles of chivalry
furnish pretty stories of knights-errant hieing forth at
the bidding of fair ladies to make conquests in distant
fields of battle. Akiba went forth at Rachel's bidding;
and is not the mastery of knowledge a victory as renowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
as that of war? A wonderful pupil he became,
for he had the gift of enthusiasm. But while he was
winning renown at the Academy, she, alone and at a
distance, was battling with poverty, at one time having
to sell her hair to buy food for her child. But still the
self-sacrificing woman would not permit his return.</p>

<p>One day it was announced in the village in which she
lived that the great scholar, Rabbi Akiba, was about to
visit it. He came, surrounded by many disciples, and as
the crowd of admirers gathered about him, they pushed
aside a poorly clad woman who tried to reach his side.
But espying her, he parted the crowd and caught her in
his arms. To the astonished spectators he declared, "All
that I know I owe to her, for she was my inspiration."</p>

<p>So far the romantic side of his life. On its literary
side he was a great <em>Tanna</em>, and famous scholars came
from his School. His method of interpreting new Law
from old was based on the theory that no word or particle
in the Pentateuch was redundant; if any appeared in the
text that it seemed could be dispensed with, then it must
have some hidden significance. This changed the law of
Moses from a limited group of unvarying precepts to
a living fount of continuous tradition, and made the laws
of the days of the Jewish monarchy capable of modification
and enlargement to fit Israel's life under the Roman
Empire. Interpretation that would produce new precepts
to meet the changing conditions of later times was undertaken
by Hillel (p. 113) but never before reduced to so
complete a system as was done by Rabbi Akiba. On such
a principle there was no end of the possible deductions
from Scripture. Yet the Rabbis were too earnest and too
conscientious knowingly to abuse it. The theory worked
in the interest of progress. The institution of this method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
has earned for Akiba the title of "father of rabbinic
Judaism."</p>

<p>He further gave an impetus to the classification of the
<em>Halachoth</em> already begun before his day. This classification
of the Oral Law was called <em>Mishna</em>, or Second
Law, of which we shall hear more later on.</p>

<p>He, too, had a voice in fixing the canon of Scripture.</p>


<h4>Akiba's Ethics.</h4>

<p>Here follow some of his sayings:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How favored is man for he was created in the
Image" (of God).</p>

<p>"&mdash;Who slays a man sins against the devine image."</p>

<p>"Take thy seat below thy rank until bidden to take
a higher place."</p>

<p>"God is merciful but He does not permit this
mercy to impair His justice."</p>

<p>"Everything is foreseen, yet freedom of will is
given to man."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is also ascribed to him on doubtful authority the
maxim, "Whatever God doeth He doeth for the best."</p>

<p>There is a mystic note throughout his teachings; mark
the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Everything is given in pledge ... the office is
open, the broker gives credit; there is the ledger
and the hand writes; whoever wishes to borrow may
borrow, but the bailiffs daily exact; the judgment
is fair; and everything is prepared for the Banquet."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the spirit of Hillel's Golden Rule he regarded the
greatest principle of Judaism the law "Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>He was always entrusted with tasks of delicacy and
consideration&mdash;the notification to R. Gamaliel that he had
been impeached, to R. Eliezar that he had been excommunicated.
To the latter he broke the disagreeable news
in these words: "It seems your brethren turn away from
you."</p>


<h4>Law and Faith.</h4>

<p>Akiba established an Academy at Bene Barak. There
was a wonderful fascination about the man that attracted
hundreds of students to him&mdash;tradition says thousands.
That was in part due to the enthusiasm of his <em>faith</em>. An
instance of his faith is illustrated in his visit to Rome,
with some of his colleagues, to intercede on behalf of his
people. They burst into tears at beholding Rome's splendor,
mentally contrasting it with Jerusalem's desolation.
He met their tears with a hopeful smile: "The present
ruined condition of our beloved land foretold by the
Prophets, only assures me of the fulfilment of their
brighter prophecies of our ultimate triumph."</p>

<p>Alas, even faith may have its drawbacks! Akiba's
deep conviction that the restoration of Judea's independence
was at hand, to be effected by the advent of
the Messiah, induced him to encourage the revolt that
was quietly but steadily spreading among his disaffected
brethren.</p>

<p>Hadrian, little understanding the spirit of this people,
reported to the Senate after making a circuit through
the Roman provinces, that all was peace. He was both
foolish and cruel enough to display his absolute power
and Israel's complete subjection, not only by altogether
withdrawing permission to rebuild the Jewish Temple,
but by ordering a heathen shrine to be reared on its
site, thus completely to paganize Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the last straw. The aged Rabbi Joshua
went to implore the emperor to desist from this wanton
project, but in vain. It was one of the last acts of the
Patriarch's life. When he died it was said good counsel
ceased in Israel. Like Antiochus of old, Hadrian wished
to obliterate Judaism&mdash;and Christianity, too, for that matter,&mdash;and
make the idolatrous worship of Serapis universal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<h3>LAST STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY.</h3>


<h4>Bar Cochba.</h4>

<p>Preparations for rebellion had been carefully planned
for some years. Arms had been stored in caves. Akiba
was the inspiration of the revolt, its Deborah, let us say.
But who was to be its Barak? The times created the
man. A hero appeared to lead the forces of Israel whom
the multitude in admiration called Bar Cochba (son of a
star). This title may have been suggested by the name
of his birthplace, Koziba, but chiefly also because he was
regarded by the enthusiasts as the long-looked-for Messiah.
This man, of colossal strength and strategic resources,
was going to make Rome feel the power of a
scorned people. Reinforcements came fast to the banner
of the supposed Messiah, scion of David's house, who was
to throw off the yoke of Rome and restore the throne of
Judah. Soon he had half a million men at his back.</p>

<p>The Roman governor, Tinnius Rufus, who is the Talmud's
archetype of cruelty, fled with his garrison. In
the first year of the war fifty fortresses and a thousand
towns capitulated before the advancing arms of Bar
Cochba; for the presence of the beloved Akiba gave
confidence to all. We might say of him as was written
of Moses, "When Akiba raised his hand, Israel prevailed."</p>

<p>Hadrian, who first slighted the insurrection, had soon
reason to fear it. His best generals were dispatched to
Judea only to be repulsed. Already Bar Cochba was
having coins struck with his insignia. Alas the act was
premature. King Ahab once said, "Let not him boast
who putteth on his armor as he who taketh it off." In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the meantime Roman prisoners of war were treated with
great forbearance; indeed some heathens, impressed with
the enthusiasm of the Jews, had joined their ranks.</p>


<h4>General Severus.</h4>

<p>Eventually, after Bar Cochba had held sway for two
years without cavalry and had repulsed every Roman
army, Hadrian, alarmed, summoned the great general,
Julius Severus, from distant Britain. The Jewish focus
of operations was at Bethar, south of Caesarea, and one
mile from the Mediterranean, and fortifications had been
placed north, west and east to hold control of the country.
Jezreel commanded the centre.</p>

<p>Like Vespasian, the great general Severus, decided on
siege rather than attack. So he steadily cut off supplies
and provisions and also barbarously put to death all
prisoners of war. There was no Josephus to give us
vivid details of this campaign, so we only know its general
result. The three great outlying fortresses on the
frontier were first mastered. The next battle took place
on the field of Jezreel. One by one the Jewish fortresses
fell. The whole Judean army was now concentrated in
Bethar where the decisive battle must be waged. It was
the Jerusalem of this war. Severus resolved to starve
it out. For one year the Jews bravely held out against
the finest army of the age. At last some Romans found
a way into Bethar through a subterranean passage which
some Samaritans, it is said, betrayed. Then followed an
awful carnage in which Roman horses "waded to the
nostrils in Jewish blood." More than half a million souls
were slain and thousands more perished by fire and hunger.
Yet so great were also the Roman losses that Hadrian
in his message of the campaign to the Roman senate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
significantly omitted the formula, "I and the army
are well."</p>

<p>In the year 135 Bethar fell and tradition places it on
the same date so disastrous in Jewish annals&mdash;the 9th
of Ab. The Roman soldiers kept up a war of extermination
against the scattered bands that still held out.
Many who had taken refuge in caves were brutally massacred.
All the Jews throughout the Roman Empire
were made to feel the weight of Hadrian's anger in
heavy taxation. As though wantonly to mark its complete
desolation, the plow was passed over Jerusalem.
North of it was built a Roman city&mdash;Aelia Capitolina.
On the Temple Mount was erected a shrine dedicated to
Jupiter, with the vindictive purpose of obliterating the
very name of Jerusalem. (And it <em>was</em> forgotten&mdash;for
one hundred and fifty years.) No Jew dared enter that
city under penalty of death. But all this was but preliminary
to his real punishment of those who were called
rebels only because they failed. Keener sighted than
Vespasian, who blotted out the Nation but tolerated the
Faith, Hadrian saw that there was only one way to crush
the Jew; that was by crushing his religion. To that abortive
purpose he now devoted himself with all the inhumanity
of a Pharaoh. To the cruel but cowardly Tinnius
Rufus, who had fled at the first alarm, that task was entrusted.
Judaism was proscribed. Obedience to its Law
was declared a capital crime. Should they commit physical
or spiritual suicide was the dilemma that now faced Israel.
Was ever a people reduced to such straits?</p>


<h4>Law and Life.</h4>

<p>A few were ready for ignoble acquiescence and called
it submitting to the inevitable, forgetting that "inevitable"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
is an elastic term that varies with our moral determination.
Meeting secretly in a garret, the Rabbis
considered the momentous question of the religious policy
of this critical hour. They decided that while this
terrible decree lasted the people might disregard Jewish
observances under duress, since the Law was given, not
that they should die, but live by it. But fearing that their
lenient proclamation might be mistakenly applied to the
fundamentals of religion and morals, they made this
safeguard: Even to save his life, no Jew must commit
the sins of <em>idolatry</em>, <em>adultery</em>, or <em>murder</em>. This vitally
important declaration, involving the all-compelling sanction
of the second, sixth and seventh commandments,
became an abiding principle in Judaism.</p>

<p>But many of the Rabbis themselves refused to take
advantage of the leniency they were willing to grant
to others, and determined to obey every injunction of
Judaism. In particular they determined to teach the
Law to their disciples, on which the continuance of the
Jewish tradition depended&mdash;though they knew that death
would be the penalty of discovery. Roman spies were
everywhere ready to pounce upon any who committed
the "crime" of fulfilling the precepts of Judaism in obedience
to the dictates of conscience. Some were only fined,
but others were put to death with tortures too cruel
to tell.</p>


<h4>Martyrdom.</h4>

<p>There were ten famous martyrs among the teachers of
the Law. One of these, Chananyah ben Teradion, had
the scroll of the Law he was expounding, wound round
him and was burnt in its flames&mdash;wet wool being placed
on his heart to prolong his agony. His executioner, inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
by such lofty example of faith and courage, sought
death with him on the same pyre.</p>

<p>Another, Rabbi Judah ben Baba, gathered some of
his disciples about him in a lonely spot, to ordain them
as rabbis by the rite of <em>Semicha</em>, already explained. Roman
soldiers discovered him. He bade his pupils fly.
They refused to obey until he pointed out that having
learnt from him important decisions of the Law, it was
their duty to live and teach them to others. Later they
found him pierced with three hundred lances.</p>

<p>Rabbi Akiba was among the martyrs and would not
avail himself of the temporary suspension of the ceremonial
Law. Reproached for exposing his life by teaching
the Law he answered in a parable that has since become
famous, that of "The Fox and the Fishes." Seeing
the frightened fish swimming from nets set to entrap
them, a crafty fox on the bank called out, "Come up on
land and escape the snares of the sea." "Nay," advised
the counsellor among the fish, "far wiser will it be to remain
in the water, your native element, even though made
perilous by the nets of men." Was not Judaism the
<em>native element</em> of the Jew?</p>

<p>Soon this noble teacher was seized and cast into prison.
Rufus ordered him to be flayed to death by iron
pincers. But religion cannot be killed in that way. In
the midst of his agonies, a seraphic smile illuminated his
face. "Daily," said he, "I have recited the <em>Shema</em>,
'Love God with heart and soul and might,' and now I
understand its last phrase&mdash;'with all thy might,'&mdash;that is
even though He ask thy life; here I give Him my life."
With this wondrous recital of Israel's prayer, this sweet
soul, whose opinions may have brought him some opponents,
but whose character all loved, passed away. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
parable of "The Fox and the Fishes" contained a profound
truth exemplified in himself; for, dying in his native
element, the Law, he lives immortally in the Jewish
heart; aye, through the inspiration of his death and that
of others like him, does Israel abide to-day. Here was
another application of the "suffering servant" in Isaiah's
fifty-third chapter.</p>

<p>Thus ended Israel's last struggle for liberty. It severed,
too, the last link that yet united the Jewish Christians
to the parent Jewish body. For they said, "Why
hold further relation with a community completely crushed
and discredited in the eyes of all the world?" They
believed that Judaism's collapse and disappearance was
at hand.</p>

<p>Rome first despised the Judean revolt and then had to
send its greatest general to quell it. Compare the similar
experience of Britain with the Boers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3>R. JUDAH, "THE SAINT," AND HIS TIMES.</h3>


<p>Sorrowfully the Jews now took up the burden of life
once more. In spite of dreadful devastation and dreary
outlook the faith and spirit of the majority remained unbroken.
Hadrian had tried to eradicate Judaism, but he
had failed. The defeated were still the victors. In the
year 138 Hadrian was succeeded by the more humane
Antoninus Pius. The religious persecution was stopped,
Rome's normal toleration of Judaism was resumed. The
Sanhedrin was reopened at Oosha, the Presidency being
still retained in the family of Hillel. Rabbi Simon, the
Nasi, was the author of the maxim, "The world rests
on three pillars&mdash;Truth, Justice and Peace." Compare
the "world's three pillars" of Simon the Just. (p. 30).</p>


<h4>Mair and Beruriah.</h4>

<p>Rabbi Mair was a unique figure of this time. He is
said to have given one-third of his means to support poor
students. Not at first recognized because of his youth,
he gave expression to the maxim, "Look not at the vessel,
but at that which it contains; for there are new flasks
full of old wine and old flasks which contain not even new
wine." Did not Rabbi Joshua express a similar sentiment?</p>

<p>Rabbi Mair was a broad man who gladly gathered
knowledge from all, Jew and non-Jew alike. Mark this
bit of wisdom: "Who studies the Law for its own sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
is worth the whole world and is loved by God and man."
Is not the study of the Law <em>for its own sake</em> the very essence
of religion? He would illustrate his lessons by
fables in the portrayal of which he was wonderfully gifted.</p>

<p>His wife, Beruria, is the most renowned&mdash;or perhaps
the only renowned&mdash;woman in Talmudic annals. We
might compare her to the Shunamite (<small>II</small> Kings, iv.),
whom the Bible calls a "great" woman. Great was Beruria
in strength of character, in dignity and withal in
motherly affection. She was indeed a helpmeet to her
husband and to many of her people in a time of storm
and stress. Her own parents had been martyrs in the
Hadrianic war. She was a scholar too. Her keen penetration
and at the same time her womanly tenderness are
revealed in her interpretation of the text, "Let sinners
be consumed out of the earth." (Psalms civ. 35). Not
<em>sinners</em>, but <em>sin</em>. Then indeed will be fulfilled the hope at
the conclusion of the text&mdash;"The wicked will be no more."</p>

<p>Her strength of character is perhaps best revealed in
the pathetic story told of the consoling way in which
she broke to her husband the terrible news of the death
of their two sons. Some "jewels" had been entrusted
to her, which she so highly prized that it was hard to give
them up; what should she do? They must be returned
said R. Mair. In this way fortifying him with consolation
for the sorrow awaiting him in this double bereavement,
she gently led him to the chamber where the dead
children lay.</p>


<h4>Judah ha-Nasi.</h4>

<p>As the epoch of the Tannäim opened, so now it closed,
with a remarkable man&mdash;Rabbi Judah, called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>
The Nasi, i.e., greatest of all. And no Nasi before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
him had been permitted to exercise so much power
over the Sanhedrin,&mdash;now located in Sepphoris in Galilee.</p>

<p>Like so many of his predecessors, he devoted much
of his wealth to the maintenance of students of the Law,
and fed the poor during a famine. He came to be known
as "the Saint." His most valuable service was the complete
codification of all the Halachoth that had been
gradually accumulating since post-Biblical time. While
similar collections had been made before his time, commenced
by Hillel, amplified by Rabbi Akiba and revised
by Rabbi Mair, his final editing of the previous work
became the officially accepted condensation of the Oral
Law&mdash;the Mishna, superseding all earlier collections.</p>

<p>It is treated in the following chapter.</p>

<p>Rabbi Judah, not only compiled the teachings of others,
but he left valuable maxims of his own:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Be as careful of the observance of a light precept
as of a weighty one."</p>

<p>"Balance the material loss involved in the performance
of a precept against its spiritual compensation
and the present desirable fruits of a sinful
deed against the injury to thine immortal soul."</p>

<p>"Know what is above thee: A seeing eye, a hearing
ear, and that all thy actions are written in a
book."</p></blockquote>

<p>No Nasi received so much reverential regard from the
people at large. While he was dying, they gathered
around his house, declaring in the exaggeration of grief
that they would slay the person who would dare announce
his death. At length there came forward Bar Kappara,
a man of broad scientific attainments and withal a man
of delicate imagination. In fact, he was a poet too, as
may be judged by the way in which he announced Rabbi
Judah's death: "Angels and mortals contended for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
ark of the covenant; the angels have conquered, the
ark of the covenant is gone."</p>


<h4>Other Famous
Teachers.</h4>

<p>Just a passing word on other great men of this epoch.
Rabbi Jochanan showed his breadth of view in encouraging
the study of Greek and opening up its great literature
to Jewish youth, and particularly in his recommendation
of it for girls. This urging of the cultivation of the female
mind formed a pleasing contrast to the prevailing
practice&mdash;the comparative neglect of the education of women&mdash;which
practice survives in some of our communities
to-day!</p>

<p>To this period also belonged that keen logician, Resh
Lakish, likewise renowned for his colossal strength and
his scrupulous honesty. He discerned that the Book of
Job was not a history, but a life problem put in the form
of a story. He also taught that Hell has no real existence.
Not that he or his age altogether denied a future
retribution for the wicked. But Hell never appealed
strongly to the conviction of the Jew. Certainly the
Synagogue does not teach the doctrine of "everlasting
punishment" to-day.</p>

<p>Another teacher, Rabbi Simlai, searched the Scriptures
and enumerated 613 ordinances of Judaism&mdash;365
negative and 248 affirmative precepts. He found them
further reduced to eleven principles in the 15th Psalm;
in Isaiah xxxiii. to six; in Micah vi. 8 to three; in Isaiah
lvi. to two; and in Amos v.-4 to one: "Seek ye Me and
ye shall live"; to one also in Habbakuk ii.-4. "The just
shall live by his Faith."</p>

<p>Nor must we forget that group of rabbis who, investigating
the religious and educational condition of various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
towns and finding in one place no teachers, asked
the magistrate to present the guardians of the city. He
marched forth the armed men. "No," said the rabbis,
"these are not the guardians, but the destroyers of a city.
Its true guardians are the teachers."</p>

<p>Let us mention in this group, too, Rabbi Abbahu, the
last of the great men of the Palestinian schools, renowned
not so much as an expert on the <i>Halacha</i> as a keen <i>Hagadist</i>.
This is another way of saying that he was not so
much a subtle jurist as a great <em>preacher</em>. He was a student
of human nature. His keen insight on one occasion
chose as the worthiest to pray for rain, a man bad by
repute, but who, he had discerned, was noble in character.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<h3>THE MISHNA.</h3>


<p>All the supplementary laws that grew up around the
<em>written</em> Codes of the Bible were called, by distinction,
the <em>Oral Law</em>. These included the decisions of the
Scribes (p. 19), the Pairs (pp. 87-8) and the Tannäim
(p. 186). Rabbi Judah the Nasi made a compilation of
all of these and called it The Mishna. Derived from the
Hebrew verb <em>shanah</em>, to learn or repeat, the Mishna is
popularly known as the Second Law. It became the recognized
code for all legal decisions, and the authorized
text-book in all the schools.</p>

<p>It now took its place beside the Law of the Pentateuch,
and just as that first Law was a text for further development,
so too we shall see that this Second Law, containing
Halachoth of the <i>Sopherim</i>, the <em>Pairs</em> and the
<i>Tannäim</i>, became the parent of a vast growth of precepts
and prohibitions in the interpreting hands of the generations
now to follow.</p>

<p>The Mishna is divided into six groups (Sedarim) containing
sixty subdivisions (Mesechtas), as follows:</p>

<h4>IV. DAMAGES: CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LAW.</h4>

<p>1, First division&mdash;general; 2, Second division&mdash;Suits between
master and servant, etc; 3, Third Division&mdash;Municipal
and social regulations; 4, The Sanhedrin and Criminal
Law; 5, Punishment by flogging; 6, Oaths; 7, Decisions
between opposing traditions; 8, Idolatry (crime
as well as sin); 9, Ethics of the Fathers; 10, Accidental
Offences.</p>


<h4>V. SACRED THINGS.</h4>

<p>1, Sacrifices; 2, Meat offerings; 3, Slaughtered animals
for food only; 4, The first born sacrifice; 5 and 6, Redemption
and Exchange (see Levit. xxii); 7, Excommunication;
8, Profanation; 9, Temple sacrificial services;

<h4>VI. PURIFICATION.</h4>

<p>1, Household furniture; 2, Tents and houses; 3, Leprosy;

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>About 150 authorities are quoted in the Mishna, involving
about two thousand statements. Here are a
few specimen sentences:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From what time should we begin to read evening
prayers (Shema)? From the hour when the priests
enter to partake of their offering till the end of the
first watch, according to R. Eleazer; (other) sages
say till midnight. Rabban Gamaliel says, till dawn.
Once it happened that his sons returned (late) from
a feast. They said to him, 'We have not yet recited
(the Shema).' He replied, 'If it is not yet dawn, the
obligation to read it still abides; nay further, where
the sages have said, 'till midnight,' their injunction
extends it till dawn."&mdash;Opening paragraph of <i>Mishna</i>.</p>

<p>R. Nechunjah b. Hakanah was accustomed to offer
a short prayer on entering and leaving the Academy.
His (disciples) asked the appropriateness of such
prayer. He replied: "On entering I pray that no
harm should happen through me, on departing I give
thanks for my lot."</p>

<p>"It is man's duty to offer a prayer at the occurrence
of evil, just as he prays at good fortune; for
Scripture says, 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,
with all thy heart, with all thy soul and with all thy
might,' 'With all thy heart'&mdash;with thy two inclinations
of good and evil. 'With all thy soul' (life)&mdash;even
though He (God) take thy life. 'With all thy
might'&mdash;with all thy substance."&mdash;<em>Prayers</em>, i, 1.</p>

<p>"On New Year all who enter the world, pass
before Him (God) like sheep to be judged, as Scripture
says: He fashioneth their hearts alike, He
understandeth all their doings."</p>

<p>"On six (different) months messengers are sent
forth (to report on the occurrence of the New Moon);
On Nisan on account of the Passover; on Ab, on account
of the Fast (ninth); on Ellul, on account of
New Year; on Tishri, to adjust the Festivals; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Kislev, on account of Hannukah; on Adar, on account
of Purim. In the days when the temple stood
they (the messengers) also went forth on Iyar, on
account of Minor Passover" (see Numb. ix, 10-12).</p>

<p>The following are prohibited from testifying:&mdash;he
who gambles with dice, he who lends money on
usury, he who trains doves for racing purposes, he
who traffics in the produce of the seventh year and
slaves.&mdash;<cite>New Year</cite>, ii, 8.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is a specimen piece from Sanhedrin, with accompanying
notes, translated for a forthcoming work,
<cite>Library of Post-biblical Hebrew Literature</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They (the Judges<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>) examined them (the witnesses)
with seven searching questions: "In what sabbatical
year? In what year? In what month?
What date of the month? What day? What hour?
What place?" R. Jose said, "What day. What
hour? What place? Did you know him? Did you
warn him?<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In a case of idolatry, whom did he
serve? And with what did he serve?"</p>

<p>The more searching a judge is in his examinations,
the more praiseworthy he is. It happened
that the son of Zaccai examined (even) concerning
the stems of the figs.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And what difference is there
between investigations and examinations? In investigations
if one should say, "I don't know," his
testimony is worthless. In examinations, if one
should say, "I don't know," and even two should say,
"We don't know," their testimony stands. Whether
in investigations or examinations, when they contradict
each other, their testimony is worthless.</p>

<p>One witness said, "on the second of the month,"
and another witness said, "the third of the month,"
their testimony stands; because one knows of the
intercalary month, and another does not know of the
intercalary month.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> One said, "on the third," and
another said, "on the fifth," their testimony is worthless.
R. Judah said "it stands." One said, "on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
fifth," and another said, "on the seventh," their testimony
is worthless, because at the fifth (hour) the
sun is in the east, and at the seventh the sun is in
the west.</p>

<p>And afterwards they introduce the second (witness<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>)
and examine him. If both their statements
agree, they open the case for the defense. If one
witness says, "I possess information to clear him,"
or one of the disciples (of the Sanhedrin) says: "I
possess information to condemn," they are ordered
to keep silence. If one of the disciples says, "I
possess information to clear him," they bring him
up, and seat him between the judges, and he does
not go down during the whole day.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> If there be substantial
information, they give him a hearing. And
even when he (the accused) says, "I possess information
for clearing myself," the judges give him a
hearing; only there must be substantial information
in his words. If the judges find him not guilty, they
release him, but if not, they defer his verdict to the
next day.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While the Mishna is strictly a code only, still its underlying
structure is religious. The moral is everywhere
impressed. One of its sections is a Book of Morals
called Ethics of the Fathers, iv. 9, from which rabbinic
sayings have already been quoted. A complete translation
of this section will be found in the Sabbath Afternoon
Service of the Prayer Book.</p>

<p>We find no system of doctrines in the Mishna and no
formulated creed. A bad life is summed up in the general
term&mdash;<em>epicurean</em>, which probably meant sensual self-indulgence
and scoffing scepticism. The Jew is not asked
to believe in God's existence. That is taken for granted;
atheism hardly came within his ken. He is asked rather
to shun anything that tends to polytheism. Revelation
and Resurrection are regarded as fundamental beliefs.
He who denies them will be deprived of future life. To
withhold immortality from him who disbelieves it we
might call poetic justice.</p>

<p>While the ceremonial law was rigorous, its observance
was saved from being mechanical by the importance
laid on sincerity of intention and on inner devotion. Not
the brazen serpent but the repentant heart cured afflicted
Israel in the wilderness, the Mishna reminds us,
pointing its moral with the quotation from the prophet
Joel, "Rend your hearts, not your garments." To go
beyond the Law in the keeping of one's word merits the
highest praise. Many prohibitions were imposed against
actions not wrong in themselves, as barriers against possible
wrong. These formed a "fence around the Law."</p>


<h4>Amoraim.</h4>

<p>The acceptance of the Mishna as the Canon of
Jewish Law curtailed&mdash;theoretically at least&mdash;the freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of the rabbis who now followed, in the evolving of
new Law. This later group of teachers was henceforth
at liberty only to <em>expound</em> the Mishna. They are therefore
called <i>Amoräim</i>, expounders, to distinguish them
from the Tannäim, that class of teachers who interpreted
direct from the Scriptures and whose work closed with
the Mishna.</p>

<p>The Mishna tended still further to emphasize the legal
character of Judaism (p. 19). While it may have robbed
the individual of spontaneity of religious action, it
strengthened the bulwarks of moral law.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Notes and References.</span></h4>

<p>Another collection similar to the Mishna and arranged
on the same plan, was called <i>Tosephta</i> (addenda). This
contains for the most part commentaries on Scripture and
much of what has been called Agada (p. 187).</p>

<p>"The Mishna is for the most part, free from the
blemishes of the Roman code. There are fewer contradictory

is infinitely purer than that of the mediaeval casuists."&mdash;<span class="smcap">E.

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<h3>BABYLONIA AND ITS SCHOOLS.</h3>


<p>Ever since the Bar Cochba war, the numerical centre
of gravity of the Jews had shifted to Babylonia, and
soon after the compilation of the Mishna in Palestine,
Babylonia became the religious centre too.</p>

<p>This fertile country, in which history began, lay between
the Euphrates and Tigris, with the Persian Gulf
at the south. The name Babylon is sometimes used in
Jewish annals to include the surrounding lands, with a
southwestern boundary, as far as the Arabian Desert.
This second "Land of Israel" had been a home for the
Jews since the first forced exile there in the year 600
<small>B. C. E.</small>, in the days of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. From
Babylon came both Ezra and Hillel, though in the four
centuries intervening between these two men, we hear
nothing of Jewish life in Babylon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>


<h4>Babylon's
Varied Rulers.</h4>

<p>This land had varied fortunes. The home of the
Babylonians&mdash;one of the most important of the Semitic
families and one of the most ancient civilizations&mdash;it was
conquered by Cyrus the Persian, about 540 <small>B. C. E.</small>
About the year 330 it was taken by Alexander in his
triumphant march through Asia and became part of the
Seleucidan Empire, (see p. 28). This brought into it
something of a Greek atmosphere. In the year 160
<small>B. C. E.</small> it was conquered by Parthia&mdash;an Asiatic nation
dwelling south of the Caspian Sea. This regime continued
for four centuries, though the Parthians exercised
no influence whatever on the Jews. In the year
226 <small>A. C. E.</small> a Neo-Persian dynasty was re-established.
This continued till the coming of the Arabs in the seventh
century&mdash;a later story.</p>

<p>During all these changes in the controlling power,
the Jews continued in Babylonia undisturbed. When
Judea fell, in the year 70, almost an annihilating catastrophe
to those at hand, their life went on without a
break, except that it brought to the new home a large
number of Jewish refugees. So that by the second century
after the Christian era, Babylon had become the centre
of greatest Jewish influence and activity. Trajan
had tried to conquer the land, but failed (p. 203). So
Babylonian Jews remained out of the reach of the
Roman grasp.</p>


<h4>Resh Galutha.</h4>

<p>What was their status here? Since the time of
Cyrus the government had been Persian. Given almost
complete political independence, the Jews simply paid
taxes to the ruling power. As Persia had granted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Jews the privilege of administering their own affairs in
Judea so, naturally, the same permission was granted
in Babylonia. There was this important difference.
The head of the Judean community had been the High
Priest; those were the days when the Temple stood. When
we turn to Babylon in the century following Jerusalem's
overthrow, we find the governor of the Jewish community
was called Exilarch or <i>Resh Galutha</i>, Head of the
Exile. <i>Galuth</i> was a word freighted with emotional
meaning to our fathers.</p>

<p>The Resh Galutha, as distinct from the High Priest
of an earlier day, was entirely a civil functionary, and
the office carried more power. As Exilarch he was recognized
by the government and occupied a place among
the Persian nobility. At first but collectors of revenue,
these officials were later treated as princes&mdash;perhaps as
a mark of gratitude for the Jewish support when Parthia
was fighting Rome. A good deal of pomp came to
be associated with the office. These Exilarchs were all
chosen from the House of David, and so represented
a quasi-royalty. The line continued unbroken till the
eleventh century. They exercised complete judicial
authority among their own people. Unlike the Patriarch
or Nasi of Judea, with whom we may also compare
them, they were not necessarily learned in the Law.</p>

<p>The Jews of Babylonia were for the most part engaged
in agriculture, commerce and handicrafts, and
even in work on the canals. Fortunate indeed were
they to have again secured a home beyond Rome's cruel
control, where, undisturbed, they might live their own
life. In the study of the Law they found inexhaustible
material for intellectual and religious activity. But how
was religion taught and the continuity of Judaism maintained
in Babylonia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>At first they were entirely dependent on the Palestinian
Academies established in Jamnia and Lydda and
other places after the fall of Jerusalem, and were altogether
subject to the Judean Sanhedrin. Many students
traveled to Palestine to study at its schools. But after a
time the community grew strong enough intellectually
to establish academies of its own. The heads of the
Academies corresponded to the Judean Patriarchs, only
that all civil power was vested in the Resh Galutha,
above mentioned.</p>

<p>Step by step the Babylonian students increased in
learning; and, acquiring confidence, came to feel less
the need of the guidance of the parent authority. Soon
this settlement further east claimed independent jurisdiction.
This was bitterly resented in Palestine. The removal
of the Sanhedrin to Jamnia had been the first
wrench. The second was the removal of the central
authority from the Holy Land altogether, to distant
Babylonia. But Palestine could not stem the tide. As
the fortunes of the Jews declined there, its schools declined
with them. Steadily waned, too, the authority of
the Patriarch.</p>


<h4>Rab and Samuel.</h4>

<p>Babylonian schools also produced great scholars, some
as renowned as those of Palestine. For reasons given
on p. 227 they are all <i>Amoräim</i>, not <i>Tannäim</i>. Let us
mention first <i>Abba Areka</i>, popularly called by his many
disciples Rab (Rabbi), "<em>the</em> teacher," who flourished in
Babylonia a few years after the Mishna had been compiled
in Palestine. Apart from his duties as expounder
of the Law, the Resh Galutha appointed him to the
position of supervisor of weights and measures. Occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
by this occupation to travel in outlying districts,
he discovered the ignorance of the remoter congregations.
This led to his establishment of the Academy of Sora
about the year 220. It continued a seat of Jewish study
for eight hundred years. Hundreds of pupils flocked to
Rab's Academy. Some he maintained from his own
purse. At the same time the study hours were arranged
to give pupils the opportunity of earning their living.
Some lectures were delivered to the public at large. An
Academy almost as famous was established at Pumbeditha;
another at Nehardea.</p>

<p>It was not only in the expounding of ritual and civil
law to which Rab devoted his energies, but also to raising
the ethical standard of the people. For the austere
simplicity and purity of Jewish life had sadly degenerated
in Babylonia. Wonderfully salutary and effective
was the influence of Rab in his moral crusade. He made
the betrothal and marriage laws more strict and more
decorous. He also strengthened the authority of the
Courts of Justice by resort to excommunication of refractory
persons. Deservedly was this modest man called
the Hillel of his day.</p>

<p>Usually associated with the name of Rab was the
versatile <em>Mar Samuel</em>, his contemporary. He was essentially
the rationalist of his age who discouraged with
his hard common sense the dreamers who were awaiting
the speedy and miraculous coming of the Messiah. In
Jewish Law his ability chiefly was directed toward the
interpretation of civil jurisprudence, for which he was
especially fitted. As judge of the Court of Nehardea,
he made a brilliant record. His most famous decision
and that which most affected the Jews, was expressed
in the phrase, <i>dina d'malchuthah dina</i>,&mdash;"The law of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
land is the law for us." This means that it is our duty
as Jews to obey the laws of the countries in which we
live. This principle tended to reconcile our fathers to
the lands of their exile, taught them their true relation
to them, and was in the spirit of the message of Jeremiah
to the very first exiles in Babylon&mdash;"Seek the peace of
the country whither ye are exiled and pray to the Lord
for its welfare." The ultimate result of Samuel's dictum
was that the better the Jew, the better the patriot.</p>

<p>Samuel had the courage of his convictions. For
when the Persian king, Shabur I (under whose rule the
Babylonian Jews were living), was engaged in war against
Asia Minor, many Jews fell, who were fighting
in the ranks on the opposing side. Yet he would not
countenance mourning for his fallen coreligionists since
they had fought against his king!</p>

<p>Babylonia, with its broad unbroken plains that gave
such wide survey of the heavens, had early become the
cradle of astronomy, and Babylonian Jews were expert
in this science. So versed was Samuel in the course of
the stars that he once said, "The tracks of the heavens
are as familiar to me as the streets of Nehardea." His
astronomical knowledge enabled him to arrange a fixed
calendar and made Babylon further independent of Judea
in deciding the dates of the festivals. As already stated
(p. 186) these had previously been decided by the appearance
of the New Moon in Palestine. Samuel was
also a renowned physician and applied rational remedies,
when the world of his day clung to superstitious nostrums.
But medicine and astronomy were characteristic
accomplishments of the Jewish rabbis. Samuel did not
scorn to learn from the Persian sages. While greatly
esteemed, not all of his contemporaries realized how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
profound a scholar he was. For in a sense he was a man
in advance of his time. We understand him better to-day.</p>

<p>With all his intellectual gifts, he was modest, self-denying
and wonderfully tender-hearted. He had many
laws passed to safeguard the interests of the poor and
helpless, and, decided that the Court must take orphans
under its fatherly protection.</p>

<p>In the patriotic incident above mentioned, it was
seen that he practised what he preached. Here is another
instance. He had laws passed against exorbitant prices.
When grain he had purchased cheaply, rose in price, he
still sold it cheaply to the poor. What a needed lesson
for our times! Here are two of his maxims:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Deceive neither Jew nor pagan."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Respect the man in the slave."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>Zoroastrism.</h4>

<p>What was the religion of Israel's Babylonian neighbors?
The Parthians were inclined toward Hellenism
and exercised no religious influence on the Jews. But
when the Persians again gained control of Babylonia
(226 <small>C. E.</small>,) they brought with them their own religion&mdash;Zoroastrism.
Zoroaster or Zarathustra was a great religious
genius who flourished about 800 <small>B.C.E.</small> He reformed
the old cult of the <em>Magi</em>, i. e., a caste of Persian
priests and sages. His teachings are contained in the
Parsee bible&mdash;the <i>Avesta</i>. The cardinal doctrine of this
faith was dualism; that is, it explained the existence of
evil in the world as the persistent conflict of two great
spirits&mdash;Ormuzd, spirit of light and good (God), and
Ahriman (devil), spirit of darkness and evil. In the process
of ages Ormuzd and good will prevail. The sun
is the visible representation of Ormuzd and fire the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of his energy. So Ormuzd was worshipped
under the symbol of fire. This worship spread over a
large part of Asia. It did not deserve to be classed with
the idolatries of the heathen world that brought so many
immoralities in their train, for we see even while we must
disagree with its recognition of a devil, that it expressed
exalted ideas and urged its followers to live moral
lives. But the rise of this Neo-Persian dynasty, awakening
new religious energy, led later to a passing persecution
of all non-fire-worshippers.</p>

<p>At the opening of the sixth century, Mazdak, a new
zealot for the religion of the Magi in Babylonia,
tried to impose on all under his rule certain
dangerous doctrines of his own that tended to undermine
the moral foundations of society. Naturally the
Jews, always normally a chaste people, stoutly resisted.
This meant fight. Again must they lay down the book
for the sword, or rather, take up the sword for the cause
of the Book. Led by the Resh Galutha Mar Zutra II,
they actually succeeded in throwing off the Persian yoke
altogether for some seven years; but they were, of
course, ultimately brought into subjection, and consequently
many martyrs were added to the Jewish roll of
honor.</p>


<h4>Babylonian Schools.</h4>

<p>This incident carries us ahead of our narrative. To
return:</p>

<p>The Babylonian schools&mdash;<i>Metibta</i>, as each was called
(<i>Yeshiba</i>, Hebrew), continued to grow until they drew
far more students than had been reached in Palestine,
many of whom became great Amoraim. Babylon, in
fact, was now a very large Jewish colony regulated by
the laws of the Bible and Mishna as interpreted in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Academies. Even the Resh Galutha was in later times
often a Jewish scholar, as for example, Mar Ukba. In
addition to the <i>Resh Metibta</i>&mdash;head of the School&mdash;there
was a <i>Resh Kallah</i>, President of the General Assembly&mdash;an
institution not found in the Palestinian Academies.
These were for the benefit of visiting students and met
twice a year in the months of Adar and Elul.</p>

<p>Most renowned of Rab's successors was Rab Huna,
who died in 297. Following the recognized precedent,
not to use the Law as a spade, he earned his living by
farming.</p>

<p>Reverence was shown to Judea now only in so far that
the pious desired to be buried there. Later persecutions
in Roman provinces, of which Judea was one, brought
still more refugees to Babylonia.</p>

<p>The next generation of scholars we must pass over
rapidly with just a word. In Pumbeditha we may mention
Rabba, who believed in the saving sense of humor,
and also set himself the more serious occupation of
classifying the Halachoth accumulated since the Mishna
had been compiled. He gave to his students this fine
principle,&mdash;"He who does good for reasons other than
the good itself, it were better he had never been born."
The method of deduction as taught in the Babylonian
Schools was more subtle than that of Judea. Its hair-splitting
tendency in the next generation of Amoräim
occasionally degenerated into casuistry. But even that
was the fault of a virtue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<h3>CHRISTIANITY THE STATE CHURCH OF
ROME.</h3>


<h4>Rome's Decline.</h4>

<p>Now we must turn our glance westward again&mdash;to
Rome. At the death of Antoninus Pius in 161, two
emperors reigned conjointly&mdash;Varus, a degenerate, and
Marcus Aurelius, a philosopher. The Roman Empire
was becoming steadily demoralized. It was at the mercy
of a series of degraded creatures who engaged in scandalous
conflicts for the bauble of royal power. At times
the purple was offered to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>But in 222 the throne came into the hands of the
high-minded Alexander Severus. Unlike most of his
predecessors, he respected Judaism, and Hillel's Golden
Rule was inscribed on the walls of his palace. So his
reign meant thirteen pleasant years for the Jews&mdash;a
little break of sunshine through the lowering clouds.</p>

<p>After the death of Severus, degeneracy again set in
and usurper after usurper seized the throne. Rarely
was the monotony of upstart emperors broken by a better
type of man such as Diocletian. The demoralized condition
of the State was reflected in the people at large.
Paganism, even at its best, had failed as a scheme of
life. Roman society was hopelessly corrupt and on the
eve of collapse. The people no longer believed in the
supposed divinities Jupiter and Apollo. The philosophers
tried to explain them away as abstract ideas. The ceremonies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of the temple became mummeries. The augurs
(priests who were supposed to indicate the nature of
events by the flight and cries of birds) could not look
each other in the face without laughing.</p>

<p>The more earnest prayed for something better. Had
Judaism not been discredited and under a ban and its
observers spurned as an alien race, it might have been
more largely sought&mdash;though its ceremonial code was
exacting, its moral code severe, and its sole spiritual God
seemed abstract and aloof to worshippers of divinities
that could be seen. Judaism made not an iota of concession
to win a single pagan to the fold. As it was, in
spite of discouraging conditions, many would-be proselytes
knocked at the doors of the Synagogue.</p>


<h4>Why Christianity
Appealed to Romans.</h4>

<p>But for many reasons, Christianity was in a better
condition to make converts. Most of its adherents had
come through conversion, and proselytism was a cardinal
item in its program. The eagerness of the Christians
to bring a religious message to the heathen, deserves
high praise and must not be underrated, though
they betrayed weakness in being too ready to make concessions
to pagan nations for the sake of winning converts.
The semi-idolatrous idea that Jesus was at once
man and God was a familiar conception to the pagan
mind. The dramatic picture of his dying on the cross
to save mankind appealed to their emotions. The treatment
of the Hebrew expression "holy spirit," as a being&mdash;a
separate divinity, introduced a third element into the
God-idea&mdash;the "Holy Ghost," (old English: spirit.) This
made the Christian divinity a Trinity: God, the Father,
Jesus the Son, and the Holy Ghost. But a three-headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
God, so revolting to Jewish ideas, was quite a recognized
theological notion in the heathen world.</p>

<p>With these additions, so alluring to the pagan mind,
the nobler Jewish teachings, which were Christianity's
ethical foundations, were more readily accepted. Christianity
became popular in Rome. Its adherents were found
in all ranks. When they were a small and feeble group,
the Roman emperors had persecuted them. But now,
they were in the majority. The tables were turned. Only
minorities are persecuted. Alas the Jews remained a
minority.</p>


<h4>Constantine.</h4>

<p>Thus it was that an emperor named Constantine decided
first to give toleration to all cults and ultimately
to adopt Christianity&mdash;"partly from a genuine moral
sympathy, yet doubtless far more in the well-grounded
belief that he had more to gain from the zealous sympathy
of its professors than to lose by the aversion of
those who still cultivated a languid paganism." This
act made it the religion of the empire. But since Rome
was mistress of half the civilized world, this acquisition
of power and numbers at once gave to the new Faith
an eminence it has never lost. The effect of this promotion
was profound and lasting and vitally affected the
destiny of Israel.</p>


<h4>Judaism and
Christianity Contrasted.</h4>

<p>The attitude of enthroned Christianity was at once
inimical to the parent Faith. At first sight it would
seem that it might be more kindly disposed to a religion
to which it owed so much and to which it was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
closely related. Alas to confess it&mdash;for such is human
nature&mdash;the very closeness of the relationship was the
cause of its enmity. It regarded the very persistence of
Judaism as a denial of its theories and as a challenge
to its claims. Christianity declared the law abrogated;
Judaism called it religion's keystone. Christianity declared
that the Messiah had come; Judaism maintained
he had not. Christians called Jesus a divinity&mdash;Son of
God; the Jews spurned this as blasphemy. The Church
taught a Trinity; the Synagogue made the indivisible
Unity of God its cardinal principle. Spiritual monotheism
became for the Jew a passion.</p>

<p>The first act by which Christianity exercised its new
power was to prohibit Jews from making converts to
Judaism and to reward those who deserted it. Thus it
conspired for the gradual elimination of the Jewish
Faith.</p>

<p>As its ranks rapidly swelled, Christianity continued
to make consciously and unconsciously more and more
concessions to the heathen beliefs and customs that were
deeply rooted in the hearts of people, who accepted the
new creed more or less superficially. The original Essene
ideas from which it had sprung were completely
lost to view. Taking the imperial government as its
model, the Church reproduced Roman administration in
its systematic organization, even to its despotic demand
of sole sway. It enforced a rigid uniformity of doctrine;
it organized a hierarchy of patriarchs and bishops whose
power was enforced by the State and whose provinces
corresponded with the administrative divisions of the
Empire, the emperor being head of the Church. In the
year 325 a Council was called at Nicæa (Asia Minor) to
draw up the official creed of Christianity. For it laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
great stress on <em>belief</em>. This marked another distinction
from Judaism, which, so far, had formulated no creed
and had no particular theory of salvation. The Nicæan
Council condemned the doctrines of the followers of
Arius, a Christian whose idea of God was closer to
Judaism, and declared the equal eternity and divinity of
the three persons of the Trinity, with more decided
emphasis. So the Arians were henceforth regarded as
heretics. It further decided, that the Festival of Easter
(which was the Jewish Passover readapted to commemorate
the resurrection of Jesus) should now be arranged
independently of the Jewish calendar.</p>

<p>The policy of suppression directed against Judaism
commenced by Constantine was continued with greater
ardor by his son, Constantius. He forbade intermarriage
and imposed the penalty of death on Jews who made
proselytes of Christian slaves. He even prohibited their
converting heathen slaves. Further prohibitive acts followed.
This hostile attitude was continued for centuries.</p>

<p>Thus the Jews in the Roman Empire were transferred
from a heathen to a Christian regime. Quietly they
continued on the even tenor of their way and prayed
with greater fervency for the restoration of their ancestral
home and for the speedy coming of the Messiah;
it meant for them the coming of light and liberty.</p>


<h4>The Calendar.</h4>

<p>It became necessary for Hillel II., Palestinian Patriarch,
in 359, to establish a fixed calendar based on that
of Samuel of Babylon, (p. 234) to guide the people as
to the time of celebrating New Moon and Festivals, as
in these troublous times they could not always transmit
the news obtained by observing the heavens. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
"second" day of the Festivals, for lands outside of Palestine,
now no longer needed, was maintained as a matter
of sentiment and is maintained still in conservative
Judaism.</p>

<p>This planning of a Jewish calendar by which the
Festivals were computed perpetually and yet kept in
their natural seasons, was a wonderful piece of astronomical
and arithmetical ingenuity. For a lunar year of
twelve months is shorter than a solar year of three-hundred
and sixty-five and a quarter days. To average
the difference and thus prevent, for example, Passover
eventually occurring in Autumn and Tabernacles in
Spring, an additional month (second Adar) was added
seven times in every nineteen years. Further, the calendar
had to be so devised that certain Festivals should not
fall on undesirable days&mdash;for example to prevent the
Day of Atonement falling on Friday or Sunday. This
ancient calendar is still our guide for the Jewish year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<h3>THE DIVISION OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.</h3>


<h4>Julian.</h4>

<p>But a brief check was made on Christian advance and
its pitiless attempt to suppress Judaism in the coming
to the throne of Julian in 361. For this emperor did not
endorse the new religion, but accepted the old Roman
cult of the Pantheon, though in its most idealized form,
preferring to purify instead of abolishing it. But it was
too late; it had been weighed in the balance and found
wanting.</p>

<p>Julian, whom the Church styled "the Apostate," was
both tolerant and philanthropic, and a man who fostered
learning. As between Christianity and Judaism, though
bred in the former, to which he continued to grant perfect
freedom of observance, his inclination turned rather toward
the latter, and he held it in high esteem. He removed
the restrictive laws and special taxes against Judaism,
imposed by his predecessors. He even took steps for the
rebuilding of the Temple at Jerusalem. The Jews were
transported with delight and began at once sending contributions
toward its erection with greater zeal than was
even shown, according to Scripture, by that generation
in the wilderness in their gifts toward the Tabernacle.
The Christians looked on with consternation, and regarded
every unfavorable interruption as the miraculous
intervention of heaven. Not a supposed miracle however,
but a real event, brought the project to nought.
Julian died on the battlefield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>


<h4>Two Roman
Empires.</h4>

<p>In the meantime Rome was failing fast. The conflict
for the throne on the death of each new emperor,
showed that the Empire was crumbling from within.
Long before the days of Constantine armies were electing
their generals to the imperial dignity all over the
empire. The throne was propped up a little longer by
gaudy trappings, but this meant heavier taxation and
further slavery. Finally the overgrown and undermined
body split in twain, each half maintaining a
separate existence. Byzantium, afterwards called Constantinople,
was the capital of the Roman Empire of the
East, while the city of Rome remained the centre of the
Western half. The division was finally completed in the
year 395. Although both were Christian, the duel empires
were menaced by too many enemies from without to
have the leisure to renew the anti-Jewish laws&mdash;for a
time.</p>


<h4>Huns, Goths
and Vandals.</h4>

<p>The influx of "barbarians," as all people outside of
Rome were called, now came thick and fast. While
some were absorbed in a friendly way, impressed with
Rome's grandeur, and even served in its army, younger
and healthier peoples looked contemptuously upon the
decaying Empire and sought to absorb it rather than
be absorbed. Even before the division, Julian had to
keep off the incursions of the Franks and Alemanni
(Germans). Theodosius, called the Great, bravely resisted
the inflowing races, but he fought against destiny
and therefore fought in vain. Driven by the Huns, a
Scythian people from Tartary, under the leadership of
Attila, the Goths crossed the Danube into the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
territory as refugees; but cruelly treated, became enemies
and began devastating the Western division of the empire.
Alaric in 410 had sacked the imperial city itself. The
Goths, to whom after much fighting, Rome granted important
concessions, also&mdash;like Rome&mdash;fell into two divisions&mdash;the
Ostragoths (Eastern), who settled on the
Black Sea, and the Visigoths (Western), who occupied
Dacia from the Dnieper to the Danube.</p>

<p>These details make dry reading; but the break-up of
the Roman Empire after occupying the centre of the
world's stage for four hundred years, marks the transition
from antiquity to the Middle Ages. This change
of his environment was in a measure to change the Jew.</p>

<p>Let us complete this general survey. Already hordes
of Suevi, Burgundians, Alemanni and Vandals had invaded
Gaul and set up a Vandal Empire in Spain, where
they contended with the Visigoths for control. Genseric,
called the scourge of God, invaded Africa in 429 and
devastated the coast from Gibraltar to Carthage. It was
he, by the way, who seized the Temple vessels that
Titus had taken from Jerusalem. They had passed, like
their first owners, through many vicissitudes. Next, the
Huns began laying waste the Western Empire, though
finally defeated by the Gothic king, Theodoric. At last
Odoacer, in 476, at the head of barbarian mercenaries,
dethroned the last emperor, and the Roman Empire of
the West came to an end in that year.</p>


<h4>Persecution of
the Jews.</h4>

<p>In the meantime Christianity held the reins of power
in the surviving eastern half of the Roman Empire. Its
Church Fathers began to regard it as a part of their
function to preach against Judaism. The people at large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
followed by burning synagogues or turning them into
churches. But the Emperor Theodosius I. protected the
Jews. Later, Bishop Cyril cruelly drove them out of
Alexandria where they had had such an illustrious
career since the days of Alexander the Great. No redress
was made to them for loss of home and property. His
disciples, following this barbarous precedent, seized the
cultured Hypatia, a teacher of Platonic philosophy,
whose rare learning had made her home a gathering
place for students and scholars,&mdash;and the fanatic crowd
rent her limb from limb.</p>

<p>But it was a bigoted and savage age. In mentioning
the cruelly fanatic bishops, let us not forget the kind
ones&mdash;Bishop Hilary of Poictiers in Gaul, at whose
funeral the sympathetic Jews expressed their sorrow in
the recital of Hebrew Psalms.</p>

<p>With Theodosius II, emperor of the eastern division of
the Roman Empire, who came to this Byzantine throne
in 408, began the systematic restraint of Judaism&mdash;the
harsh discrimination against Jews before the law. They
were prohibited from building new synagogues,
from exercising jurisdiction between Christian and Jew,
and from owning Christian slaves. The bishops and
clergy began fomenting attacks in different localities,
forcing baptism on some by threat. Ultimately the Patriarchate
of Judea, the office of Nasi, was abolished in
425, after the Hillel family had enjoyed this dignity for
three and a half centuries.</p>

<p>Israel suffered, too, at the hands of Christian ascetics
who went to grotesque extremes and imposed absurd
privations upon themselves to express religious zeal. Some
condemned themselves to stand on pillars&mdash;hence called
"pillar saints"; some to live as hermits in the desert. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with them all Jewish persecution was deemed a kind of
piety, the logic being that Jewish beliefs were opposed to
the truth and the Jews were the enemies of God. The
most famous of these pillar saints was Simeon, surnamed
Stylites, meaning pillar. As long as the Roman Empire
of the West lasted, Jews were excluded from most public
offices. The monies hitherto voluntarily contributed
to maintain the Patriarchate were, now that this Palestinian
official was deposed, demanded perforce to continue as
a Jewish tax to aid a hostile State. Thus did Christian
Rome follow the precedent of pagan Rome. This was
the kind of treatment that they were now to meet in all
Christian lands, marking the beginning of the Jewish
<em>Middle Ages</em>.</p>

<p>Still Christian divines were glad enough to sit at the
feet of Jewish scholars and learn from them the Hebrew
tongue. In this way Jerome was enabled to make from
the Hebrew a new translation of the Bible into Latin. It
was called the <cite>Vulgate</cite> (Latin Vulgata, for public use).
It has remained the authorized translation of the Catholic
Church to this day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<h3>THE TALMUD.</h3>


<p>The times were becoming so uncertain in Babylonia as
well as in Palestine that the Jews felt it necessary now to
collect and <em>write down</em> their varied traditions and laws
to insure their preservation. The sages could no longer
trust the transmission by word of mouth; they could no
longer rely on their memories, marvelous though these
were. So they were reluctantly compelled to overcome
their sentimental objection to writing down these traditions&mdash;which,
as the very title, <em>Oral</em> Law showed, should
be transmitted from mouth to mouth, inscribed, as it
were, only on the tablets of the mind. Perhaps, too,
they felt that writing would crystallize the <i>Halachoth</i> at
the point where they were transcribed, into unchangeable
decisions and prevent their further development. For
while unwritten, they were fluid and could be modified
from age to age. As a matter of fact, the writing down
of the laws <em>did</em> tend to crystallize them, and thus retarded
the progressive growth of Jewish Law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Gemara.</h4>

<p>The work of codifying and writing down the Oral
Law was commenced by Rabbana Ashi about the year
400. Placed at the head of the declining Academy of
Sora, he breathed new life into it. His knowledge won
him both esteem and authority such as had been granted
to Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi, compiler of the Mishna in Palestine
about two hundred years earlier. But Rabbana
Ashi's was a vaster task&mdash;the compiling of all supplementary
laws that had grown out of the Mishna proper
and from all the Mishna collections in the course of two
hundred years. It included, too, the discussion and incidental
material that developed from every legal or moral
problem, together with all the logical steps that led to the
final deduction. This vast after-growth or commentary
was called <i>Gemara</i>, which means completion. Together
with the Mishna, which formed the text, it was called the
Talmud. This commentary, Gemara, is far bulkier than
the Mishna. Sometimes a few lines of Mishna would
call for pages and pages of Gemara.</p>

<p>For about half a century Rabbana Ashi and his disciples,
particularly Rabina, labored on this gigantic
task. The completed work was called the <i>Talmud Babli</i>
(Babylonian), as it was not only written in Babylonia, but
contained largely the decisions attained in the Babylonian
schools. Though do not forget that its Mishna text was
written in Palestine. The final touches were made about
the year 500. It contains twelve folio volumes or 2,947
leaves.</p>

<p>A similar work had been done in Palestine about the
year 400. This Mishna commentary was called the Palestinian
Talmud. Whether it originally contained commentary
on all the Mishna we cannot say; but in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
copies now extant there is only commentary to the first
four of the six sections of the Mishna and to a few additional
chapters. For this reason it is a less important
work than the Babylonian Talmud and but a quarter of
its size. Indeed, when we speak of the Talmud, we usually
mean the Talmud Babli.</p>


<h4>The Contents.</h4>

<p>The two great divisions of <i>Halacha</i> and <i>Agadd</i> have already
been explained in the chapter on the Mishna
(xxxi). These same two classes of material, the legal
and the narrative, characterize the Gemara. It will be understood
at once then that the Talmud is not merely a
code of laws for Jewish guidance, though primarily that
is its purpose. It gives us also, though incidentally, an
insight into the manners and customs of the Jews, their
theological views and general reflections on life; their
hopes and their sufferings for a period of some six hundred
years&mdash;"A work in which a whole people had deposited
its feelings, its beliefs, its soul." We have fragments
of biography of Jewish scholars, bits of inner history
under Roman and Persian rule, homely philosophy
of the sages; glimpses too of their weaknesses and occasionally
of their superstitions&mdash;all the more reliable because
unconsciously portrayed. Interspersed between
their legal discussions will be found an anecdote, an abstract
thought of the rabbi whose decision is quoted, a
bit of humor, a picture of Oriental civilization. As direct
outgrowth of many of their ritual arguments, we are
introduced to their science; astronomy and mathematics
in the drawing up of their calendar; botany in their agricultural
laws; hygiene, anatomy and physiology in the
<i>shechita laws</i> (slaughtering animals for food); and natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
history and medicine in various laws. There is,
of course, very unequal value in their data, and naturally
they shared some of the errors of their age.</p>

<p>The legal discussions in themselves reveal keen mental
acumen, subtle logic, "deductive reasoning raised to
the highest power;" they display a vivid sense of justice
and philanthropy; and, touches of harshness too&mdash;wrung
from a patient and forgiving people in the hour of agony.</p>

<p>The study of the Talmud was to become the chief occupation
of the Jews for many centuries. It was a world
in itself in which they lived, and in which they could forget
the cruel world without. Its study reacted on their
character. First the Jew made the Talmud, then the
Talmud made the Jew.</p>


<h4>Talmudic Literature.</h4>

<p>Like the Bible, the Talmud produced a literature still
vaster than itself. While the <i>Gemara</i> is a commentary,
it needed later commentaries to explain it to the student&mdash;for
although so diffuse in treatment, its language is
terse. Frequently a letter stands for a word and a word
for a sentence. Therefore in editions of the Talmud to-day,
Mishna and Gemara together form the text and are
printed in the centre of each page, while commentaries
in smaller type are grouped around it. Since the days of
printing all editions are paged alike.</p>


<h4>Saboraim.</h4>

<p>After the completion of the Talmud, the work of the
Academies became preservative rather than creative.
While not adding to the laws now gathered in the Talmud,
the rabbis reviewed them and formulated from them
complete codes for practical application. This tended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
give a finality to the laws so far evolved, which had
both its good and bad side. This undertaking gave to
this next school of commentators the name of <em>Saboräim</em>&mdash;revisers
or critics&mdash;the third group of law expounders.
(For first group, <i>Tannäim</i>, see p. 186; for second group,
<i>Amoräim</i>, see page 228). They edited the Talmud and
amplified it with <em>agadistic</em> material and finally brought
it down into the form in which we have it to-day.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Notes and References.</span></h4>


<h5><em>Language of the Talmud</em>:</h5>

<p>The Mishna is written in Hebrew, and so too are some
of the older quotations in the Gemara. Many Greek
words are adopted, of which <em>Sanhedrin</em> is one; some Latin
words too. But the bulk of both Gemaras is written in
a dialect of Aramaic&mdash;we might say Jüdisch-Aramaic
just as we speak of Jüdisch-Deutsch to-day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A knowledge of grammar was brought to Persia
(Babylonia) from Greece, which resulted in the important
service of introducing vowel points and accents. This
tended to simplify the study of Hebrew Scriptures and
made the text more certain.</p>


<h5><em>Ethics of Talmud</em>:</h5>

<p>The ethics of the Talmud have been touched upon incidentally
in preceding chapters, and at length in the
two following. For a systematic treatment, read
Part iv., Outlines of Talmudic Ethics, in Mielziner's
<cite>Introduction to the Talmud</cite>. See also <cite>Ethics of
Judaism</cite>, Lazarus (translation), J. P. S. A.</p>

<p>Read "On the Study of the Talmud," <cite>Studies in Judaism</cite>,
S. Schechter, J. P. S. A. 1908, for rabbinic parallels
with New Testament teachings.</p>


<h5><em>The Law of the Talmud</em>:</h5>

<p>In a note on the Mishna it was pointed out that it was
free from some defects of Roman law. This does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
exclude the fact that the rabbinic <i>halacha</i> was largely indebted
to Roman law. On this Darmesteter says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Certain departments of legislation, such as the
laws on slavery and prescription ... are almost
entirely inspired by Roman legislation. But all they
borrow takes on modifications under the manipulation
of the rabbis. The Jewish mind transformed
the alien elements by impressing upon them its peculiar
character. And from this vast crucible in which
three centuries had melted down materials of diverse
origin gathered by the schools, was to emerge the
essentially uniform and homogeneous work of Talmudic
legislation."&mdash;<cite>The Talmud</cite>, translated by Henrietta
Szold, J. P. S. A.</p></blockquote>


<h5><em>Themes for Discussion</em>:</h5>

<p>(a) Compare Bible and Talmud as literatures.</p>

<p>(b) In what sense can it be said that "the Talmud
made the Jew?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<h3>SAYINGS AND STORIES OF THE SAGES OF
THE TALMUD.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"Let me make the ballads of a people and
I care not who makes the laws."</p></blockquote>


<p>The maxims with which the rabbis occasionally endorsed
their decisions and the bits of humor with which they
relieved the tension of argument, may give a deeper insight
into their character than their laws. These morsels
of homely philosophy and casual reflections on human
experience best reveal, too, their outlook on the world and
on life. So in its way the <i>Agada</i> is quite as precious a
legacy from the Fathers as the <i>Halacha</i>.</p>

<p>The writing of parables of which some of the rabbis
were masters, is almost a lost art; it seems to have died
out in literature. But no moral is pointed so aptly as
through a tale and no teaching impressed so lastingly
as through a story.</p>

<p>Many a Hebrew philosopher like Socrates, the Greek,
and the yet earlier prophet (<i>nabi</i>) would make the
highway his school-house and the passing crowd his disciples.
Darmesteter suggests that the lesson might have
been conveyed in somewhat in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Who wishes to live long," cries an <i>Agadist</i> in
the open street; "who wishes to buy happiness?"
The original questions attract a crowd demanding
to know the orator's secret. "Thou desirest to live
many days," he answers, "thou wishest to enjoy
peace and happiness? Keep thy tongue from evil
and thy lips from speaking guile. Seek peace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
pursue it. Depart from the evil and do good." And
paraphrasing these words of the Psalmist (Ps. xxxiv,
13-15), he developed his ideas in the midst of the attentive
crowd.</p></blockquote>

<p>The parables and maxims that follow have been gathered
promiscuously and are classified here under appropriate
heads.</p>


<h4>God.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Show me your omnipresent God," said the Emperor
Trajan to R. Joshua. "He cannot be seen,
but let us try to look at one of his ambassadors,"
replied the rabbi, pointing to the midday sun. "I
cannot," said Trojan, "the light dazzles me." "Can
you then expect to gaze upon the resplendent glory
of the Creator?"</p>

<p>A Roman philosopher asked: "If your God dislikes
idolatry, why does he not destroy the idols?"
Quickly came the wise reply: "Shall He destroy the
sun and the moon because the foolish worship them
and thus injure the innocent also?"</p>

<p>"Who denies idolatry may be called a Jew."</p>

<p>"He who possesses knowledge of God's law without
fear of Him, the Lawgiver, is like one to whom
the inner keys of a treasury have been given, but the
outer ones withheld."</p>

<p>"God rejoiceth not at the fall of the wicked."
When the angels were about to chant their morning
hymn on the day the Egyptians were drowning, God
stayed them: "The works of My hands are sinking
in the deep and would you sing a song?"</p>

<p>"Without God's law there would be neither heaven
nor earth."</p>

<p>"The aim of creation is man's fulfilment of God's
will."</p>

<p>"The consciousness of God's presence is the great
teaching of religion."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"In all God's creation there is not a single object
without a purpose."</p></blockquote>


<h4>Providence.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Man should ever say: Whatever the All-merciful
doeth is for the best."</p>

<p>"Who hath bread for to-day and feareth for the
morrow, is a man of little faith."</p>

<p>"God adjusts the burden to the camel."</p>

<p>"We cannot comprehend either the prosperity of
the wicked or the suffering of the righteous."</p>

<p>Rabbi Akiba was alone in the wilderness at night
with but a lamp to study the Law, a rooster to waken
him, and an ass to carry him. He was inhospitably
driven from a village in which he asked shelter, and
had to camp in the open fields. A wind blew
out his light so that he could not study; a wolf destroyed
his rooster; a lion devoured his ass. But at
the occurrence of each calamity, he still said: "Praised
be God, whate'er He does is for the best." Entering
the village next morning, he found its inhabitants
slain by robbers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Complete the providential application.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is no mediator between Israel and God.</p>

<p>"If misfortune befalls a man, let him not cry to
Michael or Gabriel, but let him come unto Me:
everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be
saved."</p>

<p>God scattered Israel through the world that the
Gentile might learn the purity of Jewish teaching.</p></blockquote>


<h4>Prayer.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Prayer without devotion is body without breath."</p>

<p>"Better little prayer with devotion than much,
without."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"He who asks God for his neighbor what he needs
for himself, his own wants will be first answered."</p>

<p>"Blessed be the mother who sends her children
to the House of Prayer."</p></blockquote>

<p>(See prayer and sacrifice, page 188.)</p>


<h4>Righteousness.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Who gains the approval of good men, may hope
for that of Heaven."</p>

<p>"One should conduct himself as carefully before
man as before God."</p>

<p>"What shall man do to live; kill his (lower) self.
What shall man do to die; sustain his (lower) self."</p>

<p>"The righteous are greater in death than in life."</p>

<p>"A good man lost to his age is like a lost pearl.
The pearl remains a pearl wherever it may be; only
the owner feels its loss."</p>

<p>"Alas for him who mistakes branch for tree, shadow
for substance."</p>

<p>"To him who lacks nobility of heart, nobility of
blood is of no avail."</p>

<p>"Good men promise little and do much; wicked
men promise much and no nothing."</p>

<p>"There are three classes of friends of God; the
wronged who seek not revenge; workers for the
love of God; cheerful sufferers."</p>

<p>"The righteous need no monuments, their deeds
are their monuments."</p>

<p>"Three names are given to a man: the first by his
parents, the second by the world, the third by his
works."</p>

<p>"The best preacher is the heart, the best teacher
time, the best book the world, the best friend God."</p>

<p>"The greatest of heroes is he who turneth an
enemy into a friend."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Study of
the law.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Study is more meritorious than sacrifice."</p>

<p>"A scholar is greater than a prophet."</p>

<p>"The soul of man is the lamp of the Lord; the
law is light. God's light (the Law), is in man's
hands: man's light (the soul), is in God's hands.
Respect His light and he will respect thine."</p>

<p>"The Gentile who studies the Law is as a High
Priest."</p>

<p>"Who studies the Law in private, it will proclaim
him in public."</p>

<p>"Scholars increase the world's peace. They are
called builders for they are engaged in upbuilding
the world."</p>

<p>"I have learnt much from my teachers, more from
my fellow students, most from my pupils."</p>

<p>"The wise learn from all."</p>

<p>"He only is free who engages in the study of the
Law."</p>

<p>"The aim of learning is moral perfection."</p></blockquote>


<h4>Education in General.</h4>

<p>In the days when the Temple was still standing, education
of the young formed an important part in the life
of the Jewish people. They had schools in and out of
Judea. Ignorance was despised. "A fool cannot be pious,"
'twas said. The studies to be undertaken in accordance
with the age of the children, the previous home preparation,
the number to a class, were all carefully planned.
The curriculum comprised law and morals deduced from
Scripture and rabbinic teaching, history, grammar, languages,
according to the time, Aramaic, Persian, Greek
or Latin. Also to older scholars&mdash;medicine, hygiene, astronomy,
botany, zoology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>All Scriptural quotation of flowers were applied to
children and schools. "Teacher" was the highest title.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The world depends on the children in the school."</p>

<p>"A city without school-children will be destroyed."</p>

<p>"Touch not mine anointed." These are the
school-children. "And to my prophets do no harm."
These are the disciples of the wise.</p>

<p>"You should revere your teacher even more than
your father. The latter only brought you into this
world; the former points the way to the next. But
blessed is the son who has learnt from his father,
and the father who has instructed his son."</p>

<p>"Who does not educate his children is their enemy
and his own."</p>

<p>"Who is best taught? He who has learnt from
his mother."</p>

<p>"Who acquires knowledge without imparting it is
like a myrtle in a desert."</p>

<p>"Who are you whose prayer has alone been answered?"
"I am a teacher of little children."</p>

<p>"Bestow most care on the children of the poor,
for from them will go forth the Law."</p>

<p>"Pride is a sign of ignorance."</p>

<p>"A single coin in a jar makes the most noise."</p>

<p>"The rivalry of scholars advances science."</p>

<p>"If thou acquireth knowledge what canst thou
lack; if thou lackest knowledge what canst thou
acquire!"</p></blockquote>


<h4>Parents and Children.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Three share a man: God, father and mother.
When one honors mother and father, God says He
dwells among them; and in honoring them one honors
Him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blessed is the generation in which the old listen
to the young; doubly blessed when the young listen
to the old."</p>

<p>"Do not threaten children with punishment you do
not intend to inflict."</p>

<p>"Only when a parent induces a child to commit
sin, is disobedience justifiable."</p>

<p>"Do not limit your children to your knowledge,
for they were born in another age."</p>

<p>Rabbi Eliezar pointed out to his disciples the example
of Damah. His mother often abused him,
yet all he would say on such occasions was:
'Enough, dear mother, enough.' Once the priests
came to him to purchase a jewel. Finding his father
resting against the casket in which it lay, he asked
them to come later. They offered him a larger price.
He replied, 'I would not disturb my father's rest for
all the wealth of the world.' They waited. When
his father woke he brought the jewel; they tendered
him the larger sum offered the second time. He declined
it, saying: 'I will not barter the satisfaction
of having done by duty, for gold; give me what you
first offered and I will be content.'</p>

<p>Albini allowed none of his five children to open
the door for their grandfather or attend his wants.
That privilege must be his. Once his father asked
for water. On returning he found the old man
asleep. So there he remained, glass in hand, until
his father awakened.</p>

<p>"Reverence mother and father by neither sitting
in their seats nor standing in their places, by not interrupting
their speech nor criticising their arguments
and by giving heed to their wishes."</p>

<p>"Support the aged without reference to religion,
and the learned without reference to age."</p></blockquote>


<h4>Woman.</h4>

<p>The exalted place given to woman in Jewish teaching
is in pleasing and remarkable contrast with her inferior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
position in the orient and throughout antiquity generally.
In some respects she is made subordinate in the Jewish
law, and is given a comparatively passive place in religious
life; but on the whole the sages of the Talmudic era
nobly resisted the example of their environment, in the
reverence they paid to womanhood.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"God gave more understanding to woman than to
man."</p>

<p>"All blessing in the household comes through the
wife; therefore should her husband honor her."</p>

<p>"Man should consult his wife, treating her as a
companion not a plaything; making her what God intended,
a help-meet for him."</p>

<p>"Be careful not to cause woman to cry, for God
counts her tears."</p>

<p>"He who loves his wife as himself and honors her
more than himself, will train his children rightly."</p>

<p>Rab Jose: "I never call my wife <em>wife</em>, but <em>home</em>."</p>

<p>"He who dependeth on his wife's earnings will be
deprived of blessing."</p>

<p>"Who is rich? Who has a good wife."</p>

<p>"Culture in woman is better than gold."</p>

<p>"Woman's sense of shame is deeper than man's."</p>

<p>"He who has no wife is not a complete man."</p>

<p>"Israel was redeemed from Egypt on account of
the virtue of its women."</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<h3>SAYINGS AND STORIES OF THE SAGES.</h3>

<p class="center">(CONTINUED)</p>


<h4>Work.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Work dignifies the worker."</p>

<p>"He enjoys life who lives by the work of his
hands."</p>

<p>"Work is more pleasing in God's sight than ancestral
merit."</p>

<p>"Strip a carcass in the street and take pay for it,
and say not: 'I am a priest or a great man and
this work is beneath me.'"</p>

<p>The Fourth Commandment makes rest conditional
on work.</p>

<p>"God did not dwell in the midst of Israel till they
had built a sanctuary."</p>

<p>"Work must not be neglected for study."</p>

<p>"He who says 'I have toiled and not found,' believe
him not; he who says 'I have not toiled yet
have I found,' believe him not."</p>

<p>"Who does not bring his son up to a trade teaches
him to be a robber."</p>

<p>"It is well to add a trade to your studies to be free
from sin."</p>

<p>"Position cannot honor the man; the man must
honor the position."</p>

<p>"Famine passes by the workman's door."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Artisans need not interrupt their labors to rise
before the passing scholars."</p>

<p>"Rather be a menial than a dependent."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is a characteristic bit of rabbinic <i>midrash</i> on a
Bible text: "The dove returned ... and in her mouth
an olive leaf" (Gen. viii, 11):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"She said to the Holy One: 'Rather let my food
be as bitter as the olive, but received from Thy
hands, than honey-sweet but dependent on the hand
of man.'"</p>

<p>"It is one's duty to support a slave crippled in his
employ."</p>

<p>"O, River Euphrates, why is thy current not
heard? My deeds testify for me; what is sown at
my shores will bloom in thirty days."</p>

<p>"Judge by deeds not works."</p>

<p>"Say little, do much."</p>

<p>"Like a tree, man is known by his fruit."</p>

<p>"Say not, 'I will do nothing,' because thou canst
not do everything."</p>

<p>"One good deed leadeth to another."</p>

<p>"Thy works commend thee; thy works repel thee."</p>

<p>"He who makes another perform a deed, is greater
than the doer."</p>

<p>"A worthy action done in this world anticipates
and leads the doer to the world to come."</p>

<p>"When God said to Adam, 'Thorns and thistles
shall it (the earth) bring forth for thee,' Adam wept
and said: 'Lord of the world, shall I and my ass
eat from the same crib?' But when God further
said, 'by the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread,'
Adam was cheered and comforted."</p></blockquote>


<h4>Truth.</h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>"Truth is the seal of God."</p>

<p>"Jerusalem was destroyed because of the lack of
truth-telling people."</p>

<p>"Who breaks his word is as one who worships an
idol."</p>

<p>"Thus is the liar punished: even when he speaks
the truth, none hearken."</p>

<p>"Truth is heavy, therefore few carry it."</p></blockquote>


<h4>Justice and Honesty.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let justice pierce the mountain."</p>

<p>"The judge who renders a true judgment for but
one brief hour, is deemed as though he shared with
God in the work of creation."</p>

<p>"Judge every man in the scale of merit."</p>

<p>"Judge not your neighbor till you stand in his
place."</p>

<p>"Woe to the generation whose judges must be
judged."</p>

<p>"Rabbi Phineas hospitably received two strangers.
On departing they accidentally left behind them a
few measures of barley. They returned a year later.
'Presumably our barley is spoilt by this time: never
mind.' 'Nay,' said Phineas, leading them to his
barn. He gave them five hundred measures of
barley, the product of their few measures, which he
had sown in his fields."</p>

<p>He who lends on usury is compared to a shedder
of blood.</p>

<p>"Thy neighbor's honor and his possessions should
be as dear to thee as thine own."</p>

<p>"Be honest in trade: if goods are damaged, acknowledge
it."</p>

<p>"Credit and mutual trust should be the foundations
of commerce."</p>

<p>A prince once made a law that a receiver of stolen
property should be hanged and the thief go free.</p>

<p>"Not the mouse but the hole is the thief."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"An Israelite must not deceive even an idolater."</p>

<p>"Go to sleep without supper, but rise without
debt."</p>

<p>"Rabbi Simon bought a camel of an Ishmaelite
and later discovered diamonds under its saddle. 'The
blessing of God maketh rich,' said his overjoyed servant.
'Nay,' rebuked the rabbi: 'Return those diamonds;
I bought a camel, not precious stones.'"</p>

<p>Alexander, the world conqueror, came across a
simple people in Africa who knew not war. He lingered
to learn their ways. Two citizens appeared
before the chief with this point of dispute. One
had bought a piece of land and discovered a treasure
in it; he claimed that this belonged to the seller
and wished to return it. The seller, on the other
hand, declared that he sold the land with all it might
contain. So he refused to accept the treasure. The
chief, turning to the buyer, said: "Thou hast a
son?" "Yes." And addressing the seller: "Thou
hast a daughter?" "Yes." "Marry one to the other
and make the treasure their marriage portion." They
left content. "In my country," said the surprised
Alexander, "the disputants would have been imprisoned
and the treasure confiscated for the king." "Is
your country blessed by sun and rain?" asked the
chief. "Yes," replied Alexander. "Does it contain
cattle?" "Yes." "Then it must be for the sake of
these innocent animals that the sun shines upon it;
surely its people are unworthy of such blessing."</p></blockquote>


<h4>Kindness.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whoever showeth compassion is as the seed of
Abraham."</p>

<p>"Remove from the highway what might endanger
the property of others."</p>

<p>"To deserve mercy, practice it."</p>

<p>A sage, meeting Elijah in the thoroughfare,
asked him to reveal the worthiest in the passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
throng. First he singled out a turnkey. "He was
kind to his prisoners." Next he pointed out two
tradesmen. The sage ran to them and said, "Tell
me your saving works." They were surprised. "We
are only poor workmen, said to be cheerful and good-natured;
we sympathize with people in sorrow and
we try to reconcile friends who have quarreled. That
is all."</p>

<p>"Be not cruel to inferiors."</p>

<p>"Rather be thrown into a fiery furnace than bring
anyone to public shame."</p>

<p>"He who declines to tend the sick and he who
hateth his neighbor, are as though they shed blood."</p>

<p>"Even though thy left hand pushes from
thee, let thy right hand draw towards thee."</p>

<p>"Hospitality is a form of divine worship."</p>

<p>"Cast no stone in the well from which thou hast
drunk."</p>

<p>"One should not partake of his own meal until his
animals are first provided for."</p>

<p>"He who has no mercy on dumb animals should
himself suffer pain."</p>

<p>While Moses was tending the flock of Jethro he
noticed a lamb stray from the fold. He followed it;
it did not stop until it reached a pool and there its
slaked its thirst. "Thou dear innocent creature,"
said Moses, "had I but known thy wishes, I myself
would have borne thee in my arms to the water." So
he gently carried it back to the flock. Then was a
voice heard from heaven exclaiming: "Moses, thou
hast shown such compassion for the dumb sheep,
thou art indeed worthy to be the shepherd of the
flock of Israel."</p>

<p>"Give me your blessing," said R. Nachman to R.
Isaac. He replied, "Thy request reminds me of
the story of a weary traveler, who, after the day's
exhaustion reached a well-watered date tree. Refreshed
by its fruit and rested in its shade, he gratefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
desired to bestow upon it a blessing. 'What can
I wish thee; thou already hast foliage, shade, fruit,
water; I can but pray that thy offshoots may flourish
like thee,' 'Now, R. Nachman, thou already hast
learning, wealth, children; I can only wish that thy
descendants may be blessed like thee.'"</p></blockquote>


<h4>Charity.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Charity (righteousness) delivereth from death."</p>

<p>"Charity is the salt of wealth."</p>

<p>"He gives little who gives much with a frown, he
gives much who gives little with a smile."</p>

<p>"The truly beneficent seek out the poor."</p>

<p>"He who closes the door on the poor may have
to open it to the physician."</p>

<p>"Charity is greater than alms-giving; alms-giving
is a duty to the poor only; charity both to rich and
poor."</p>

<p>"He who gives charity in secret is greater than
Moses."</p>

<p>"A miser is as wicked as an idolater."</p>

<p>"Even he who depends on charity should practise
it."</p>

<p>Aben-Judah was the most generous of givers to
the needy. But storm and pestilence swept away his
wealth. There was left but a single field. In contented
faith he maintained his family upon that. He
only felt the pangs of poverty when the collectors of
the poor called and he had nought to give. Then he
and his wife decided to sell half their remaining
field and hand the proceeds to the charity collectors.
"May the Lord restore thee to thy former prosperity,"
said they and departed. Turning more assiduously
than ever to the plough, that very day he unearthed
a treasure. When the collectors called the
next year he made up the deficiency of the year preceding.
On receiving it they said: "Though many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
exceeded thy donation then, yet we had placed thee
at the top of the list, knowing that thy small gift
came from want of means, not from inclination."</p>

<p>King Monobases (the son of Helen of Adiabene,
who became a proselyte to Judaism, see p. 139),
unlocked his ancestral treasures at a time of famine,
and distributed them among the poor. His ministers
rebuked him saying, "Thy fathers amassed, thou
dost squander." "Nay," said the benevolent king,
"they preserved earthly, but I, heavenly treasures;
theirs could be stolen, mine are beyond reach; theirs
were barren, mine are fruitful; they preserved money,
I have preserved lives."</p>

<p>Said R. Akiba to the not very charitable Tarphon:
"Let me profitably invest some money for you."
Tarphon handed his four thousand golden denars.
Akiba distributed them among the poor, with the
scriptural explanation, "He hath given to the needy,
his righteousness endureth forever" (Ps. cxii, 9).</p></blockquote>


<h4>Humility and Patience.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Teach thy tongue to say: I do not know."</p>

<p>"Meekness is better than sacrifice."</p>

<p>"God teaches us humility. He chose but a low
mount, Sinai, from which to promulgate the Decalogue;
in a humble bush He revealed himself to
Moses; to Elijah, in a still small voice."</p>

<p>"Greatness flees from him who seeks it, and seeks
him who flees it."</p>

<p>"Rather be persecuted than persecutor."</p>

<p>"An aged man, whom Abraham hospitably invited
to his tent, refused to join him in prayer to
the one spiritual God! Learning that he was a fire-worshipper,
Abraham drove him from his door.
That night God appeared to Abraham in a vision and
said: I have borne with that ignorant man for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
seventy years; could you not have patiently suffered
him one night?"</p>

<p>"Seeking the highest good to bestow on Israel,
God found nothing better than affliction." ("Sufferance
is the badge of all our tribe,"&mdash;Shakespeare.)</p>

<p>Rabbi Joshua always advised patience and submission,
even under provocation (see pp. 193, 205.)
Once he pointed his advice with the apologue of The
Lion and the Crane: While devouring prey, the lion
got a bone in his throat. He offered a great reward
to whomever would remove it. The crane came
forward, inserted his long neck down the lion's
throat and extracted the bone. He then demanded
his reward. "Reward indeed," said the lion; "was
it not sufficient reward that I permitted your neck
to escape my sacred jaws?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Make the application to Israel.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A lover, called from the side of his plighted
wife, sent letters to her, faithfully promising to return.
Long she waited and many mocked and taunted
her. But each time she read her lover's letters,
her waning faith was strengthened.</p>

<p>Suffering Israel is the maiden; the unseen God
her faithful lover; and the Scriptural promises of
redemption are His letters.</p>

<h4>Sin.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"Put not yourself in the way of temptation, for
even David could not resist it."</p>

<p>"What the sages have forbidden on account of
appearances, is forbidden even in one's innermost
chamber."</p>

<p>"Commit a sin twice and you will think it sin
no more." The first step counts.</p>

last like a rope."</p>

will be the disappearance of oppression."</p>

favoritism towards Joseph led to Israel's Egyptian
captivity."</p>

<p>"What is the idol man carries within him&mdash;his evil
passion."</p>

<p>"Sinful thoughts are worse than sin."</p>

<p>"A sinner is foolish as well as wicked."</p>

<p>"The end does not justify the means."</p>

<p>"Say not 'sin cometh from God.' He giveth free
choice of life and death."</p>

<p>"The wicked, even while living, are called dead."</p>

<p>R. Simeon said: The whole community must
bear the blame of the individual sinner, emphasizing
his lesson with this illustration:&mdash;Here is a
boat-load of passengers. One proceeds to bore a hole
through his seat, saying, "I am only piercing my own
place." What happens? (Draw the inference.)</p></blockquote>


<h4>Repentance.</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is no repentance without reparation."</p>

<p>"Better is an hour in repentance and good deeds
in this world than all the world to come; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
better is an hour of the world to come than the

gates of tears are open."</p>

no more."</p>

<p>"One who has sinned and repented stands higher
in God's favor than the completely righteous."</p>

<p>"Repent one day before thy death." i.e. repent
every day.</p>

<p>"Improve thyself and then improve others."</p>

<p>"Love those that reprove thee, hate those that
flatter thee."</p>

<p>"The love that shirks from reproof is no love."</p>

<p>"He who does a worthy deed acquires an advocate."</p>

<p>"As the ocean never freezes, so the gate of repentance
is never closed."</p>

<p>"If you wish your fast to be acceptable to God
let it be accompanied by acts of charity and good-will."
(see Isaiah lviii.)</p>

<p>"He who says 'I will sin and repent, I will sin
again and repent again,' will ultimately lose power
to repent."</p>

<p>A ship once anchored at a beautiful island waiting
for a favorable wind. An opportunity was offered
the passengers to go ashore. Some thought
it safer not to leave the ship at all; the wind might
rise, the anchor be raised and they would be left
stranded. Others went to the island for a while
to explore it, eat of its fruits and enjoy its beauties
and returned to the ship refreshed and enlightened
by the experience. A third group lingered rather
long and scurried back as the ship was departing;
but they lost their choice places on the boat for the
rest of the journey. A fourth party indulged so
freely in the island's pleasures, that it was hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to stir them when the ship rang its bell. "There
is no hurry," so they lingered. Only after the last
warning they made a wild rush, and had to clamber
up the ship's sides; so they reached it, bruised and
maimed; nor were their wounds quite healed at the
close of the voyage. There was a fifth group alas,
who drank so deeply and reveled so wildly that they
heard neither bell nor warning. The ship started
without them and at night-fall wild beasts emerged
from their lairs and destroyed them.</p>

<p>Alexander reached the gate of Paradise. "Who
is there," asked the guardian angel. "Alexander
the Great." "We know him not, only the righteous
enter here." Then he more humbly asked for a proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
that he had reached the heavenly gate, and a piece
of a skull was given to him! Alexander's sages proceeded
to test it and finally placed it in one scale
as a balance. They poured gold in the other scale,
but the small bone weighed heavier. Alexander
added his crown-jewels and diadem. The bone out-weighed
them all. Then a sage placed a few grains
of dust on the bone; up flew the scale! The bone
was the setting of the eye. It is never satisfied
until covered by the dust of the grave.</p></blockquote>

<p>R. Joshua met a little girl by the way and asked
for some water. She handed him her pitcher, saying:
"I will also draw some for the beast on which
thou ridest." Quenching his thirst he said:
"Daughter of Israel, thou hast followed the worthy
example of Rebecca." "Rabbi," said she archly,
"Thou hast not imitated the example of Eleazar"
(Gen. xxiv 22).</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<h3>BEGINNING OF THE JEWISH MIDDLE AGES.</h3>


<h4>In the Byzantine
Empire.</h4>

<p>To turn again to the history proper. The production
of the Talmud is part of the story of Babylonian Israel.
Except that fanatic outbreak about the year 500 (p. 236)
little occurred to disturb the even tenor of their way.
They were "happy" because they "had no history."</p>

<p>But life was going hard for their brethren elsewhere.
Many were settled in the lands of the Eastern half of the
Roman Empire known as the Byzantine. It included all
ancient Rome's conquests in Asia, Eastern Europe and
Northern Africa. Our present Turkey forms the bulk of
it.</p>

<p>Yes, the status of the Jew was growing still more precarious.
In many Palestinian towns, notably Cæsarea
and Antioch, insurrections broke out, usually during the
circus races. Ravages against the Jews were actually
endorsed by the emperor Zeno. Churches were everywhere
replacing synagogues in the land which had once
been theirs, and Jerusalem became an archbishopric where
Jews were not even <em>admitted</em>. Such are the changes of
time!</p>


<h4>Laws of Justinian.</h4>

<p>Under Justinian, anti-Jewish legislation was systematized.
He was the emperor who became famous because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of the Digest of Roman law, accomplished in his
reign, in the year 541. His theory was&mdash;"one religion,
one law, one state." Against the fulfilment of such an
ideal the Jews stood, so to speak, as an obstacle. Therefore
the laws of this Digest (or rather of his later Novellae)
that concern them, are severe. Among these, was
the provision that Jewish witnesses could not testify
against Christians. Justinian, who further made them
bear the expense of the magistrate office without its privileges,
also forbade their celebrating Passover prior to
Easter! He even went so far as to prohibit the recital
of the <em>Shema</em> since he regarded its declaration "God is
one" as a protest against the Trinity! This meddlesome
intruder, furthermore, tried so to modify the Synagogue
service that it might encourage Christian ideas.</p>

<p>Altogether there was almost an unbroken monotony
of suffering under Byzantine rule. Judaism was made
to cost its followers dear. But their deep faith that Providence
would ultimately usher in a glorious dawn if
they were but patiently loyal, saved them from despair.
Under the Byzantine rule at its best they were left contemptuously
to themselves and were granted a certain
autonomy in the management of their communal affairs.</p>


<h4>Jews again
Involved in War.</h4>

<p>In the early part of the sixth century, Persia tried to
wrest Palestine from the Byzantine Empire. Jews must
look on while others fought for the country that was once
theirs. Since Byzantium was treating them so badly
and Persia (which included Babylonia), was treating
their brethren humanely, the Jews settled in Palestine,
decided to support Persia with its arms. If successful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
they could live secure under its more tolerant sway. So
under the leadership of one Benjamin, Jews mustered an
army once more.</p>

<p>The Persians, however, were ungrateful to these allies,
and when victory seemed to be theirs, not only refused
to cede Jerusalem according to promise and for which
the Jews had so longingly hoped, but even imposed oppressive
taxes upon them, thus going back upon their
own record. How cruel the world is to minorities! Further
ill-treatment induced many to enlist under the
banner of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius in 627. By
solemn treaty he promised them immunity from all punishment
for having taken up arms against him.</p>

<p>Fortune turned in his favor. Persia withdrew. The
monks now urged the triumphant emperor to extirpate
the Jews from Palestine. He reminded them of his solemn
promise of protection made to them. They told him
that a promise to Jews need not be kept; and, that to
slay them would be an act of piety! Thus sanctioned, he
began a severe massacre. Further, those old edicts of
Hadrian and Constantine forbidding Jews to enter Jerusalem
were once more enforced in 628. But Judea was
not long to remain in Christian hands.</p>


<h4>Rome's Successors.</h4>

<p>As already stated in chapter xxxiv, the Western half
of the Roman Empire had succumbed to Northern tribes
by the year 476. The Ostrogoths, led by Theodoric, became
masters of Italy, the Visigoths of Spain, the Franks
and Burgundians of Gaul&mdash;the Gaul that had been great
Caesar's pride to conquer. Here we see the beginning
of the formation of the nations of Europe. They all accepted
the Roman system of law and government to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
modified extent, and also that which now became the
Roman religion&mdash;Christianity. So the victors became the
disciples of the vanquished&mdash;a not unusual experience in
history. In each of these lands and under each of these
peoples, Israel was pretty well represented by the beginning
of the sixth century, and in each it had a distinct history.
So, in continuing our story we shall have to follow
many strands. They were treated better in these new
European countries than in Byzantine lands&mdash;at least at
first.</p>


<h4>Italy.</h4>

<p>The Ostrogoths, the new rulers in Italy, were <em>Arians</em>.
(p. 243.) The other group of Christians&mdash;the orthodox&mdash;called
themselves Roman Catholics. Catholic means universal.
Christianity claimed to be a universal Church
and Rome had once claimed a universal Empire. This
religious monopoly, the theory that this church offered
the only saving creed, did sad mischief in the coming centuries.
These Arian Ostrogoths were kinder to the Jews
than were the catholics. The greater tolerance of the
Arians may perhaps have been due to the fact that their
idea of God was a little closer to that of the Jewish. But
Arian Christians, always a small minority, soon disappeared,
just as in the early days of the church, Jewish Christians
were absorbed by pagan Christians. But as long as
these two divisions of Christendom lasted, they were very
bitter against each other. When a Byzantine army
threatened the Ostrogoths, the Jews loyally stood by those
who, if they had not treated them generously, had treated
them justly. Later we find the Jews defending the seacoast
of Naples for the Ostrogoths in 536. Only when
overwhelmed by superior numbers did they at last surrender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Thus Italy, once the country of which Rome
was the capital, was becoming the sport of nations. From
the Ostrogoths it passed to the Byzantine Empire. Then
in 589 it was seized by a tribe from the Elbe called Lombards.
Its later story is told in the sequel to this book
(<cite>History of the Mediaeval Jews</cite>).</p>


<h4>The Popes.</h4>

<p>But through all these changes, the city of Rome remained
the religious centre of the Church as Jerusalem
had been the religious centre of Judaism.</p>

<p>The Roman <em>bishop</em> (overseer) acquired power over all
bishops in other Christian centres, and became the head
of the Church with the title <em>pope</em> (Greek-father). In
the course of time these popes exercised immense power,
and we shall see kings trembling before them. For they
came to be regarded as the representatives of God on
earth. Whoever dared oppose their will was excommunicated,
i.e., cut off. Then all shrunk from the person
thus put under the ban as from a person smitten with
leprosy; for the superstitious age regarded him as accursed
and doomed. Very terrible was it when this dangerous
power was in the hands of an unscrupulous pope,
which not infrequently happened. But there were many
good popes, too, and the Jews found among them, as we
shall see, friends as well as foes.</p>

<p>Gregory I, one of the earliest and also one of the greatest,
would not allow his bishops to molest the Jews, "whom
God had found worthy to be bearers of His truth";
though he offered the bribe of remission of taxes for
their conversion!</p>


<h4>Slavery and Trade.</h4>

<p>Slavery was still a recognized institution of society, due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
in part to constant warfare, the daily business of life and
to the custom of enslaving prisoners of war. So slaves
were in nearly every household and in the fields, taking
the place of the humble toilers of to-day.</p>

<p>So we find Jews holding them likewise. They often
converted them to Judaism and in all cases were kinder
to them than most masters. But Gregory vigorously objected&mdash;not
to slavery, but to the enslaving of Christians,
and particularly to the possession of Christian slaves by
Jews. The Church greatly feared that by proselytizing
their slaves the Jews might increase their numbers. This
was to be prevented at any cost.</p>

<p>If the question were asked why Jews came to trade in
slaves, the answer would be because they were becoming
traders in general, and traffic in slaves was part of the
commerce of the age. It is then part of a larger question&mdash;how
came the Jews to seek trade as a means of livelihood?
<em>First</em>, by the law of necessity. Most other avenues
of activity were being closed to them. Not permitted
to own lands, they could hardly be agriculturists.
Gradually the army, the public service and most of the
professions were forbidden to Jews.</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, on account of their dispersion through the
world, which had its compensating advantages. United to
their brethren by close fraternal ties, speaking a common
tongue and moving frequently from place to place, the
exchange of commodities was facilitated. Then having
smaller opportunities of expenditure, and in any case of
moderate tastes, they naturally possessed ready means.</p>

<p><em>Lastly</em>, their hard fate in lands of exile, the growing
precariousness of their position under fanatic powers,
quickened their wits in the life struggle and endowed
them with the capacities that earn success in trade. (We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
are not therefore surprised to learn that the Jews invented
bills of exchange.)</p>

<p>This is all there was to justify the medieval belief in
the colossal wealth of the Jews and the fantastic notions
as to its acquisition.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<h3>IN THE SPANISH PENINSULA.</h3>


<h4>Gaul and the Franks.</h4>

<p>The "wanderings of the Jews" have begun. The drift
of the migration is westward. They are gradually leaving
the Orient and finding homes in European lands. In
Gaul, the land that is largely France to-day, Jewish merchants
from Asia Minor had found their way long before
the Christian era. After the fall of Judea, many
Jewish prisoners and slaves were brought thither. The
first places of settlement were Arles, Narbonne, Marseilles,
Orleans and Paris. We find them in Belgium too.</p>

<p>The successors of Rome in Gaul were Franks. The
Franks (free men) were a confederacy formed about 240
<small>C. E.</small> of tribes dwelling on the lower Rhine and the Weser.
The Frankish Empire, which extended far, was not
one central government, but was subdivided into several
monarchies. Under nearly all, the Jews enjoyed the
rights of Roman citizenship.</p>

<p>We find the Jewish industries varied, including agriculture
and all kinds of commerce (still in its infancy); in
medicine they had been early distinguished. Some were
soldiers too, for the restraints of the Church had not yet
reached Western Europe. Even when Christianity was
first introduced by the warrior Clovis, Jews and Christians
mingled freely and held cordial relations; though
the Jewish dietary laws occasionally caused embarrassment
and ill-will when Jews sat at Christian tables. It
was only the <em>higher</em> clergy who began to look upon these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
cordial relations with misgivings and to discourage them.
In this way hatred was <em>artificially fostered</em> by the Church.
Not till the beginning of the sixth century did a Christian
king of Burgundy begin to discriminate unfavorably
against the Jews, and to break off kindly relations by forbidding
Christians to sit at Jewish tables. Soon the
Church Councils began to issue severe anti-Jewish edicts.
So in different provinces and towns within the Frankish
empire we find restrictions such as these gradually introduced:
Jews must not make proselytes; they must not
"insult" Christians by showing themselves in the streets
on Easter; they must not be permitted to serve as judges
or as tax-farmers.</p>

<p>Their worst enemy at this early day was Bishop Avitus.
He first tried to convert the Jews by preaching
Church doctrines to them. Persuasion failing, he resorted
to violence and incited a mob to burn their synagogues.
This was in the year 576. Their fanaticism once
fed, the masses fell upon the Jews and massacre began.
Baptism was accepted by several in order to save their
lives&mdash;others escaped to Marseilles.</p>


<h4>Vicissitudes
in Spain.</h4>

<p>So far Gaul. Let us now turn to Spain or rather to
the Peninsula, for Portugal was not yet a separate kingdom,
and what is now the south of France was also included
in the Roman territory taken by the Visigoths.
Where the Jews were early settled in the lands of southern
Europe, in very remote antiquity&mdash;too early even to trace&mdash;they
were brought there as slaves in considerable
numbers after the Judean War with Rome in 70, and
were soon redeemed by their sympathizing brethren. As
in Gaul, so here, the Visigoths, being of the broader Arian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
school, regarded the Jews with cordiality and esteem, and
their superior knowledge gained for them public positions
of honor and trust.</p>

<p>So we find the public-spirited Jews gratefully defending
the passes of the Pyrenees against the inroads of the
Franks and Burgundians, and winning distinction by
their courage and trustworthiness. How patriotic the
Jew always becomes when given the barest tolerance, we
shall see right through his history!</p>

<p>Nor did they forget their religion, but became faithful
disciples of teachers sent them from the Babylonian
schools. For their well-wishing neighbors did not interfere
with their complete observance of the precepts of
Judaism.</p>

<p>But as soon as the orthodox Christians&mdash;i.e., the Roman
Catholics&mdash;obtained the upper hand, the higher clergy,
behaving identically like those in Gaul, began to sow the
seeds of mistrust in the hearts of the people, and forbade
close intercourse with Jews, as sin. Anti-Jewish
legislation soon followed, the unfair discrimination to
handicap the Jews in the race of life. They were deprived
of their public posts. How Jewish history repeats
itself!</p>

<p>Their height of misery was reached when one Sisebut
came to the throne in 612. Jews were now prohibited
from holding slaves, though slaves were held by all others
and formed a necessary class in the restricted civilization
of the age. The climax was reached when he offered
them the alternative of baptism or expulsion. Very
many preferred exile to apostacy. Some found the sacrifice
of land, home and possessions too great, and <em>externally</em>
submitted to a Faith that cruel experience had taught
them to abhor. Under his successor, Swintilla, who repealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the harsh laws, the exiles returned to the land and
the apostates to Judaism. But the Church Council re-enacted
the unnatural command of forced baptism and
the returned converts were compelled to become Christians
again. What sort of Christians could they become
under such conditions? But most cruel enactment of all&mdash;to
think that a religious council should have proposed
it&mdash;their children were torn from them and placed in
monasteries to become completely estranged from both
their Faith and their kindred. This hard law was mitigated
however by the opposition of the powerful Visigothic
nobles.</p>

<p>The next king who occupied the throne offered the remaining
Jews the same alternative of exile or baptism.
Again they submitted to banishment. Once more they
were allowed to return though under many restrictions.
But the forced converts were held in the Church with an
iron grip, while, strange contradiction, they had yet to
pay the Jewish tax! In secret and peril they still continued
to observe the Jewish festivals. But the spies of
the Church soon discovered this double life and compelled
them to spend Jewish and Christian holidays away from
their homes and in the presence of the clergy. After a
few years in which this cruel vigilance was relaxed, King
Erwig won over the clergy to his support by reinstating
this Jewish persecution with more violence than all his
predecessors. Now baptism was demanded, with confiscation,
mutilation and exile as the penalties of its rejection.
The Jewish Christians who had secretly clung to
Judaism right through, were placed under complete clerical
espionage. These abortive edicts were passed in 681.
The next king, Egica, "bettered the instruction" of his
predecessor. Jews were now forbidden to hold landed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
property, to trade with the Continent, or to do business
with Christians. In their despair, the Jews of Spain entered
into a conspiracy against this barbaric government.
They were discovered, and nearly all reduced to slavery.</p>

<p>But relief was to come from an unexpected source. A
new religion, Mohammedanism, had been brought to
life and was becoming a great power in the world. It
was destined to change for centuries the fate of the Jews
of the Peninsula and transform an iron into a golden age.
But to understand this movement, we must turn to Asia
once more and look into the life of a new people&mdash;the
Arabians.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Note.</span></h4>

<p>This age produced nothing of a literary character except
polemic replies in Latin to works written at this time
to prove Christianity from the Jewish Scriptures.</p>

<p>Why do you suppose the higher clergy opposed the
mingling of Jews and Christians and the lower, favored
it?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<h3>ARABIA.</h3>


<h4>The Land and
the People.</h4>

<p>The Peninsula of Arabia is bounded on the southwest
by the Red Sea, on the southeast by the Indian Ocean,
on the northeast by the Persian Gulf, and on the north
touches the mainland of Palestine and Syria, reaching
to the Euphrates (see second map). So that we might
say it lies between three continents. It is divided by
geographers into three parts: 1. Arabia Felix (fortunate)&mdash;the
largest&mdash;all the land between the three seas.
2. Arabia Petraea (stony)&mdash;the end adjoining the Peninsula
of Sinai. 3. Arabia Deserta&mdash;the desert between
Palestine and the Euphrates. The old Ishmaelites used
to dwell in Arabia Deserta&mdash;a land scorched by burning
sands, with scant vegetation and brackish water. These
Bedouins were brave, hardy, and of simple habits, but
restless and rapacious. The description of the wild ass in
the thirty-ninth chapter of Job well fits their character.</p>

<p>The nature of the land made the building of cities and
organized society impossible. Conditions encouraged a
lawless life, and necessity, rather than choice, tempted
the Bedouins to attack merchant caravans. A French
proverb runs, "To know all is to excuse all." While not
endorsing this dangerous maxim, we can see that their
home largely decided their character. We are all influenced
by surroundings in some degree. Yet some
make the most of even hard conditions and barren soil.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Not so the Bedouins. They never rose to greatness religiously&mdash;satisfied
to worship stars and stones and to
gratify the wants of the hour. So they have not advanced.
But of the Arabs of central and southern Arabia
we have a better story to tell.</p>


<h4>Arabian Jews.</h4>

<p>Long before the fall of the second Temple&mdash;probably
before the fall of the first&mdash;Jews found their way to
Arabia. By the time they made their presence felt there,
we find them established in separate groups or tribes.</p>

<p>There were many points of kinship between Jews and
Arabians. The Bible hints this in making Abraham the
father of both peoples through Isaac and Ishmael (Gen.
xvii, 18-20). This tradition the Arabs accepted from
their Jewish neighbors. They certainly both belonged to
the same race&mdash;the Semitic. The Semites included Assyrians,
Chaldeans, Babylonians, Syrians, Phoenicians,
Hebrews, Arabs and Ethiopians. In spite of the religious
divergence, the Jews adapted themselves&mdash;externally at
least&mdash;to the Arabian mode of life. (It is a nice question
in how far Jews should assimilate with their surroundings
and in how far stand aloof.) So, while the Jews
of southern Arabia engaged in commerce, those of the
less civilized north were agriculturists and wandering
shepherds like their Bedouin neighbors. Like them, too,
some even formed robber bands; yet here at least we
meet a favorable variation in that the Jews were more
humane to their enemies. Further, the Jews adopted the
patriarchal status of society of their Arabian surroundings&mdash;not
so dissimilar to the social life depicted in Genesis&mdash;i.e.,
each group of families lived under the guidance
of one patriarch or Sheik; such were Abraham and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Jacob. The Sheik was a kind of king and his will was
obeyed as law by the particular group under his sway.
For there was no central government. In unsettled districts,
hospitality becomes the greatest virtue, because it
represents the greatest need, and its violation, the gravest
crime. This is well illustrated in the Genesis story
(chapters xviii and xix) of the contrasted behavior of
Abraham and the people of Sodom.</p>

<p>The religious ideas of the Arabians while not gross
were primitive. They had a Holy City, later known as
Mecca, near the Red Sea border, in the centre of which
was a black stone preserved in a Temple called the Kaaba.
This they no doubt worshipped as an idol. Indeed
three hundred idols were associated with this place.
While fierce in warfare, in which they frequently engaged,
and remorseless in revenge, they mitigated these
rough tendencies by the institution of four holy months,
during which the taking of life was avoided.</p>

<p>The Jews as such were better educated than the Arabs,
and may have taught them writing, and were altogether
looked up to as the intellectual superiors of the Arabs.
Far from interfering with the religion of the Jews, the
Arabs were rather prepared to take the position of disciples.
They adopted some Jewish rites and accepted
their calendar; moreover, the Jewish teaching exercised
a salutary influence on their character. Many converts
came to Judaism unsought, and when a Sheik accepted
Judaism, the clan followed. Naturally, under such favorable
auspices the Arabian Jews lived up to their religion
with ardor and zeal, that is, as best as they understood
it. They were students of Jewish law and turned
for guidance probably both to Judea and Babylonia. They
had their school too at Yathrib, later called Medina&mdash;north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of Mecca, near the Red Sea. But the Bible was
taught in Midrashic paraphrase, rather than in the original
Hebrew text.</p>


<h4>Jussuf the Proselyte.</h4>

<p>The most important convert to Judaism was Jussuf,
the powerful king of Yemen, in the southwestern quarter
of the Peninsula&mdash;about the year 500 <small>A. C. E.</small> The
Jewish sages were invited to teach Judaism to the people
at large. The enthusiastic but unwise King Jussuf, hearing
that Jews were persecuted in the Byzantine Empire
(p. 281), put to death some of its merchants. This only
paralyzed trade and brought on war. So the Jews were
hardly fortunate in their ally, for he did not grasp the
spirit of Judaism and tried to impose it by force&mdash;i.e.,
by the sword. This recalls the forced conversions of
John Hyrcanus (p. 78). Yussuf stirred up enemies
against himself and the Jews in many surrounding lands;
his foes at last completely crushed him. Thus ended the
ill-starred Jewish kingdom. Israel might well exclaim,
"heaven save us from our friends." No, Judaism was
not destined to spread in that way. "Not by force, not by
power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord."</p>


<h4>Samuel the
Chivalrous.</h4>

<p>Like the Arabs, the Jews cultivated poetry and held
it in high esteem. Most renowned of these Jewish poets
was Samuel Ibn Adiya. His life is perhaps more interesting
than his poetry, for it shows how this stimulating
environment at its best encouraged a fine spirit of chivalry
among the Jews.</p>

<p>For Samuel was also a powerful Sheik in whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
weak and persecuted always confidently sought protection.
One day a famous Arabian poet and prince pursued
by his enemies, sought refuge in his castle. Going
forth to seek the aid of the Byzantine emperor, Justinian,
he entrusted to Samuel his daughter and his arms.
No sooner had he gone than his enemies hastened to the
castle, demanding the arms from Samuel. But Samuel
would not break his promise, so the castle was besieged.
Obtaining possession of one of his sons, the savage enemies
threatened to slay him unless the father gave up the
arms. It was an agonizing alternative to the father, but
he did not falter. "Do what you will, the brothers of my
son will avenge this deed." So at that awful cost, the
trust was kept. What wonder that an Arabian maxim
should run "Faithful as Samuel." Other poets sang his
praise.</p>

<p>But we must pass quickly over the rest of this epoch
till we reach the end of the sixth century. By this time
Judaism had widely spread and Jewish colonies were
found along the whole northwestern coast. In Medina
their numbers were particularly large&mdash;consisting of three
great tribes. They had built their own villages and fortified
strongholds.</p>

<p>It was in the year 570 that a man was born whose
name, Mohammed, was to ring through all Asia, and
whom all broad minds now recognize as one of the great
religious teachers of mankind. Closely was his fate
linked to Israel's, for again was Judaism to inspire a prophet
and give birth to another world-religion.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Note.</span></h4>

<p>Carlyle, in his <cite>Heroes and Hero Worship</cite>, says of the
wild Bedouin:&mdash;"He welcomes the stranger to his tent
as one having right to all that is there; were it his worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
enemy he will slay his foal to treat him, will serve him
with sacred hospitality for three days, will set him fairly
on his way; and then, by another law as sacred, kill him
if he can."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<h3>MOHAMMED.</h3>


<p>Mohammed, to name him by the title that he afterwards
acquired, was born in Mecca, five years after the Byzantine
emperor Justinian, and belonged to a branch of the
powerful Koreish tribe. He began life as a shepherd.
At twenty-five he married Kedija, who had employed him
as camel-driver. Traveling extensively for her, he found
his fellow-countrymen in a condition of religious neglect.
The old star-worship and fetichism were losing their
force, just as in more classic lands the divinities of Olympus
had lost their meaning, some half dozen centuries
earlier. Mohammed, given much to solitary contemplation,
yearned for something better. He became filled
with fine aspirations to uplift his fellowmen. For a period
he led an ascetic life, spending much time in prayer.
In the solitudes of the wilderness he experienced at times
a strange exaltation. Others, like himself, groping for
religious truth, were brought in contact with Jewish and
Christian colonies in Syria and Babylonia. But the idea
of one sole God, <em>Allah</em> (Arabic), he learned from Jewish
teachers. A highly nervous nature, he "dreamed dreams
and saw visions," and gave vent to his emotions in violent
outbursts.</p>

<p>It was in about his fortieth year that he felt the divine
call to preach God to his benighted Arabian brethren
after the manner of the Hebrew Prophets, whose words
had moved him deeply. He began to feel that perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
he was the ordained Messiah whom the Jews awaited. He
had learnt the Hebrew Scriptures in the more highly colored
<i>Midrashic</i> form. From what he thus learned and
from what he gathered from some hermits and from a
group of ascetic Arabians, together with his own religious
experience, he gradually evolved a religion for his
people that came to bear his name.</p>

<p>He did not reach these convictions without much anguish
of soul his spirit torn by doubt&mdash;the true experience
of every deep religious nature. First Kedijah,
then his family, then a small circle of adherents gathered
about him, convinced of his divine mission. His
vigorous personality attracted many more. At first his
purpose was not to teach a new religion, but to reinforce
the great truths recognized by the noblest natures in all
times, his own enthusiasm contributing the only new element.
The humbler classes were first attracted, the higher
holding aloof. Is that not always so? Guided by his
first teachers, the Jews, he saw the worthlessness of
idolatry and preached a strict monotheism. He also
adopted many Jewish rules, among them some of the dietary
laws.</p>

<p>But gradually he made <em>himself</em> the centre of his message.
He had some allies, but many opponents, especially
as he denounced the idols of the Kaaba and rode
roughshod over many of the cherished traditions and
superstitions of the Arabians. Partly for this reason and
partly because the success of his preaching meant the
withdrawal of rich revenues derived from the pilgrims
who came to the "holy city" of Mecca, its people began to
persecute him. His life was full of peril. A breach
with the Arabians was a breach with the world&mdash;a living
death. So, for a moment he temporized and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
prepared to make a quasi acknowledgment of the old
divinities. But with the conversion of his uncle and one
Omar&mdash;a man like himself of great force of character&mdash;he
took a rigid stand again. He was put under interdict
by the Koreish, his own family tribe.</p>


<h4>The Hegira</h4>

<p>In the meantime he suffered much privation. Among
the people of Medina however, his preaching, in which
he referred to the Jewish Scripture for endorsement, received
more kindly recognition; for among them, Jewish
teaching had, as it were, prepared the way. This
meant new converts. So in the year 622 Mohammed
bade all his followers emigrate with him to Medina. This
was called the famous <i>Hegira</i> (flight), and marked the
turning point in the movement. Medina became a commonwealth
and Mohammed its chief and judge. All disputes,
hitherto decided by combat, were now brought to
him for decision. Thus he began to build up a system
of law and justice. Here then he founded a religious settlement,
and its whole social tone was raised. He preached
particularly against greed and injustice. The bitter
blood feuds were modified, property rights were respected,
and the position of woman elevated. He had long
since condemned the barbaric Bedouin practice of putting
to death newly born daughters. The whole life of the
people of his community was ordered with a kind of military
precision in which the battle cry was, "No God
but one God."</p>

<p>Unfortunately he also proclaimed, "Who is not for
me is against me." This meant war against all outside
his adherents.</p>

<p>The cardinal precepts of the New Faith were: 1. Confession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of unity of God; 2. Stated times of prayer; 3.
Alms giving.</p>

<p>His most daring act perhaps was breaking with that
fundamental principle of Arabian life&mdash;blood relationship.
The old Arabian ethics had concentrated all duty
within tribal boundaries. These were now to be disregarded
and a new brotherhood built up, that of <em>Islam</em>
(submission)&mdash;a religious brotherhood that could disregard
even the holiest ties outside of it. Yet to ask his
followers to exchange kinship for faith was an unnatural
demand. This long meant bitter resistance; but Mohammed's
determination prevailed.</p>

<p>His followers now became an army and a remorseless
conflict was waged with all who refused to come within
the fold. This, brought his arms against the Jews. Their
strongly fortified castles were taken one by one. Completely
to break with the old regime he even ordered his
followers to attack the caravans in the "holy month of
truce, Ramadhan." This was a severe test of their faith.
Victory steadilly followed his aggressions and brought
him many converts; many deputations came in voluntarily,
dazzled into conviction by his success.</p>

<p>In 630 he had conquered Mecca. This was called "The
Conquest." Although he compelled the inhabitants to
give up their idols he compromised so far as to retain the
Kaaba and the Festival of Mecca and to reinstate Mecca
as a holy city. Abraham, now styled an Arabian, was
said to have worshipped the Kaaba stone and was credited
with being the father of the ritual. Fascinated by the
glamor of Mohammed's remarkable triumphs, adherents
came to him from all sides. What other creeds have
taken centuries to attain, he achieved in his lifetime. This
too rapid success is one of the defects of his movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
It grew too fast for excellence. So some of his successes
were failures, for to obtain them the spiritual was occasionally
sacrificed to the worldly.</p>

<p>As each new province came under his sway, its submission
was to be exemplified by proclamation of the
<i>Mueddin</i> for prayer, payment of alms-tax and acceptance
of the Moslem law. But in each instance the internal
tribal affairs were left untouched. In 632, in the
eleventh year of the Hegira, Mohammed died. But not
till Arabia was at his feet. He had founded a religion and
a State.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Note.</span></h4>

<p><em>Islam</em>, the name given to this religion, and <em>Moslem</em>, to
its followers, are both derived from a word meaning
'submission' (to God). <i>Musselman</i> is another variant.</p>

<p>A Jew, <em>Waraka Ibn Naufel</em>, is said to have been Mohammed's
chief teacher and one of his strongest supporters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<h3>ISLAM AND THE JEWS.</h3>


<p>Mohammed never forgave the Jews for their refusal
to accept him as "The Prophet" of God, superseding all
others. He had accepted so much from them&mdash;the fundamental
idea of monotheism, the chief points of the
Calendar, the Sabbath, the Day of Atonement, much of
the Scripture and Midrashic narrative, and many details
of the ceremonial law. He asked of them so little&mdash;it
seemed&mdash;to regard him as God's chosen and supreme
messenger to man, to all intents and purposes the Messiah,
whose advent was foretold in their own Scriptures,
and to whom they should henceforth look for the interpretation
of their Faith. But that "little" they could not
conscientiously give. For not even Moses, their only
recognized lawgiver, "greatest of their prophets," were
they prepared to regard quite in the way in which Mohammed
asked allegiance. Their hearts told them that
this man was not sent by God on a mission to them, however
much he may have been sent to the Arabians. He
was not <em>their</em> Messiah. So to accept him would be traitorous
to their traditions and to the teachings of the Scripture
(Deut. xviii, 15-22). For the acceptance of Mohammed
would have ultimately meant the stultification of their
religion and its submergence in a new cult of which he
would be the founder. At that rejection, his regard for
them turned to hate, and instead of allies, he chose to
look upon them as rivals, as enemies of the true Faith,
Their endorsement was the one thing needed for the complete
confirmation of his mission. Therefore, forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
how much he owed to their spiritual treasures, he became
their persecutor.</p>


<h4>Christianity
and Islam.</h4>

<p>How history was repeating itself! Was not this identically
Israel's experience with that other creed to which
its religion had given birth&mdash;Christianity? Its adherents
likewise said to the Jews, "We accept your Scriptures,
ethics and divinity. Accept only from us this individual
Jesus, <em>greatest of all prophets</em>, the Messiah, in
whom all your prophesies have been fulfilled, who represents
God's new covenant with man." And because
they refused, they were hated and spurned.</p>

<p>From endeavoring to pattern his religion as closely as
possible after the Jewish example he now in sullen resentment
sought by arbitrary changes to emphasize its
differences. Instead of turning to Jerusalem in prayer,
Mohammedans were told to turn to Mecca. He changed
the Jewish Yom Kippur (Ashura), which he had adopted,
for the holy month of Ramadhan. He altered the
Sabbath from Saturday to Friday, making it a day of
worship, but not of rest. Here again was an attitude
towards Israel parallel with its experience with Christianity;
for after three hundred years the Church had
changed the Sabbath to Sunday and rearranged its calendar
to make Easter independent of Passover. Then
like Christianity, too, he inserted in <em>his</em> Scripture&mdash;the
Koran&mdash;unkind things and calumnies about the Jews.
Yet, on the whole, the Koran holds up many Bible characters
as exemplars.</p>

<p>There was a third parallel between these two daughters
of Judaism. Just as Christianity, to win the heathen
to the fold, accepted into its theology many heathen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
rites and even beliefs, so now Mohammed, to win the
allegiance of the heathen Arabs, accepted many of their
most cherished traditions. The Kaaba Stone&mdash;an idol&mdash;was
still to be regarded reverently in the new Faith.
Lastly, Islam, like the Church, also claimed to be the one
true and universal Faith, (See pp. 198-9). Judaism
that had given birth to both, never made such claim.</p>

<p>Mohammed's conception of the future life was not as
spiritual as that of Jews or Christians. In promising
gross pleasure in the realm beyond, he unconsciously
gratified the expectations of sensual natures.</p>


<h4>The Koran or
the Sword.</h4>

<p>Let us hasten over the sad conflicts between Mohammed
and the Jews&mdash;his wars against their chiefs, until he had
succeeded in crippling their once powerful clans. The
"Battle of the Foss," 627, is one of the unfortunate blots
on the reputation of this really great man. Seven hundred
Jews were gathered in the market-place and offered
the alternative of "the Koran or the sword." But the
Jews had been inured to martyrdom. There was no hesitancy
in their choice. The grim warrior-prophet carried
out his savage threat against them. They were all slain
and the surviving women were sold.</p>

<p>All through Arabia this religious crusade was waged
against them. Thus fell the city of Chaibar, but no such
ruthless massacre was repeated. Many of the defeated
Jews were even left in possession of their lands. They
continued their losing fight but little longer against the
triumphant advance of Mohammed. By the year 628, all
the Jewish tribes had lost their independence; the sword
was taken from them. So that era of arms and chivalry
was now closed for the Jews of Arabia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>A Jewish woman, Zainab, who won Mohammed's favor,
tried to be a Judith to her people and attempted to
poison him. The dish was hardly tasted by him, so the
plot failed and she paid for her daring with her life.</p>


<h4>Spread of Islam.</h4>

<p>Mohammed must be studied from the political side
as founder of a great State as well as from the religious
side as founder of a great creed. Indeed, he was a
greater statesman than prophet. His followers believed
in him intensely and were united to him by ties that death
could no longer break. His fiery words embodied in the
Koran became their inspired Scripture. With his name
upon their lips, a crescent on their banner and the great
watchword, "Allah is God, and Mohammed is his Prophet,"
these fearless warriors carried all before them.
Islam became a great power in half a century, a power
that had come to stay. It is accepted by nearly two hundred
million souls to-day. Here was surely a great message&mdash;lifting
the Arab from the slough. We see here,
as in the rise of Christianity, the hand of Providence
bringing light to the Gentiles.</p>

<p>Under Mohammed's successor Abu Bekr, there was
a momentary falling-off, but the movement rallied under
the leadership of Omar who followed the master's policy
of spreading the new Faith by conquest. At the
head of the Mosque, (the Church of Islam) was now an
emperor&mdash;a caliph. Not so many years after Mohammed's
death not only was most of Arabia Moslem, but the
sway of Islam had reached Persia, conquered the land
and superseded Zoroastrism. Syria and Egypt were next
wrestled from the Byzantian or Eastern Roman Empire.
Palestine had been taken from Persia by the Byzantines
in 628 only to be lost again in 638 and in both wars the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
long-suffering Jews who saw their old home tossed from
one conqueror to another, had looked to the incoming
enemies as deliverers, (pp. 282-3).</p>

<p>What changes had Jerusalem seen! When the Jewish
Temple was destroyed, it became a heathen capital&mdash;Aelia
Capitolina, adorned with a heathen shrine. In its
Christian era it became a bishopric. Under the Mohammedans
a mosque held the place of honor. Such it remains
to-day.</p>

<p>Islam was now accepted in Asia, as Christianity had
been accepted in Europe, not by individuals, but by whole
nations. Somewhat intolerant at first against opposing
creeds&mdash;some of the Mussulmen were fanatics&mdash;it became
later renowned for its breadth and enlightenment. Very
soon the Jews found the Mohammedans their friends,
against whom they had nothing to fear. Jewish poets
began to hail their advent. Even in Babylonia the Moslem
sway was more liberal than had been that of the Persian
Magi in the latter years. The political, social and religious
status of the Jews was to remain undisturbed; the
same secular official was to be at their head (pp. 231, 233).
In fact, the Resh Galutha was given even heartier endorsement,
and was treated as a prince by the government,
with his civil and judicial powers increased, making
the Jewish community in Babylonia almost a State in itself.
It was the Caliph Omar who, in 638 raised Bostonai,
a descendant of the House of David, to the post of
Resh Galutha (Exilarch). The academies at Sora and
Pumbeditha were continued without a break; their heads,
called <i>Geonim</i> (Illustrious) had also certain powers and
took equal rank with the Resh Galutha. The Jews became
loyal subjects of the Mohammedan rulers, and
when Caliph Ali's successor was deposed by a rival
house (for Islam had also now split into two wings),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the Jews came gallantly to his support. Here and there
Moslem law in its freshest and noblest expression reacted
favorably even on Jewish law. New religious movements
in early stages of enthusiasm always reach high
moral levels. It will be borne in mind that the Jews in
all their past experience were necessarily influenced to a
degree by their environment, while remaining loyal in all
essentials to the traditional conception of Jewish life.</p>

<p>The ceremony of the inauguration of a Resh Galutha
was henceforth more impressive than ever. There was
quite a little court about him. Likewise the official organization
of the two Academies was very elaborate with
their President, Chief Judge, Assembly of Teachers or
Senate, and their Greater and Lesser Sanhedrin. Their
administration left its lasting impress on all Jewish communities.
All looked now to Babylonia as their religious
centre and gladly sent contributions toward the maintenance
of the Academies. The prestige of the Babylonian
community steadily grew with the extension of Mohammedan
sway.</p>


<h4>Fall of Visigothic
Spain.</h4>

<p>It was the spread of this great power that was to
bring relief to the Jews of Spain, persecuted almost
unto death. Verily the Moslem was unto them as a
savior&mdash;for his arrival brought liberty, light and peace.
After having subjected a large part of Asia, the sway of
Islam spread unresistingly westward. All the north
coast of Africa was soon under both its temporal and
spiritual control. Christendom was alarmed at the rise
of this new star and the checking of the advancing hosts
from making inroad into Europe became now the first
duty of every Christian monarch. Any warrior who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
could throw them back from his country's border at once
sprang into fame.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, none could withstand them.
Nearer and nearer they approached the borders of Spain.
There the outrageously treated Jews (pp. 291-2) awaited
their arrival as any besieged city at the mercy of a relentless
foe awaits the coming of its army of release. Already
across the narrow Straits of Gibraltar on the African
side, they were making common cause with the Moslem
and were prepared for the invasion of the Peninsula.</p>

<p>The destined hour arrived. In the year 711 a great
battle was fought in Xeres, in which the last Visigothic
king fell before the army of Tarik. City after city&mdash;Cordova,
Granada, Malaga, Toledo&mdash;fell before them,
the Jews rendering valuable aid from within. The
Mohammedans found they could not entrust their conquered
towns into more faithful hands than these Jewish
allies. Thus the Jews were raised at once from degration
and thraldom to liberty and prestige. A new light
had dawned and under the broad and cultured regime of
the Moors, as these Western Mohammedans were called,
a golden age was now to dawn for the Jews of Spain.</p>

<p>Minor typographical errors have been corrected without note. Irregularities and inconsistencies in the text have been retained as printed.</p>

<p>Missing page numbers are page numbers that were not shown in the original text.</p>

<p>The illustrations have been moved so that they do not break up paragraphs, thus the page number of the illustration might not match the page number in the List of Illustrations.</p>

<p>Mismatched quotation marks are not corrected if it is not sufficiently
clear where the missing quotation mark should be placed.</p>

<p>In the Index, hyphenation has been changed from "goatskin" to "goat-skin".</p>

<p>In the book the table of Contents lists the "Preface to revised edition" as on page v and the Introduction as on page vi. In the book, the Introduction comes before the Preface on unnumbered pages.</p>

<p>In the "Contents" for Chapter XLII, the transcriber has changed the numbers from 305-311 to 304-310 to conform to the book.</p>
